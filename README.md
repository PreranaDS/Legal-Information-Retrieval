# Legal-Information-Retrieval
SMART INDIA HACKATHON '22(Finals)... This legal information retrieval system takes a query as input and finds a list of judgments that are similar to the query(relevant judgments), in decreasing order of similarity. It is also autocompletes the query and suggests case names as the user types. The query is preprocessed using nlp techniques such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop word removal, etc. It uses tf-idf and word2vec(both pretrained google word2vec and a special word2vec trained on court data) to find similar judgments, where the tf-idf score is given more weightage than the word2vec score. Similarity matching is done based on cosine similarity. After the similar judgments have been fetched, the heuristics are applied followed by the filters. Heuristics such as court score, citation score(given most weightage), case date and page rank score(where edge weight is set to citation score) along with filters such as court, case year, judge name etc. are used. It uses LSTM trained on court data and tf for autocomplete. It makes use of flask for UI along with speech recognition to convert the spoken query into a textual query for retrieval.
Web scraping is used to train the LSTM used for autocomplete.
