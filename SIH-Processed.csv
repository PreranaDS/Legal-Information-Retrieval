The plaintiff is the son of the 1st defendant by the latter's first wife. The 2nd defendant is the son of the 1st defendant by his second wife. The 3rd defendant is the widow of a predeceased brother of the 1st defendant. The 1st defendant: has four daughters by his second wife, of whom the first had been married before and the others were all unmarried at the filing of the plaint. The eldest of these was married while the suit was pending before the District Munsif about four months before his judgment, and the other two still remain unmarried. The seventh issue in the case runs thus.The learned Advocate for the appellant in the course of his arguments referred to a verse of Yajnavalkya quoted at p. 239 of Vol. II of Colebrooke's Digest (Bk. V, Ch. 2, LXXVII). This verse is also cited in Banerjee's Stridhanam, 3rd Edition, (pages 174-5). The verse does not occur in the Vyavahara Adhyaya or Book 2 of Yajnavalkya, but in the Achara Adhyaya or Book 1, where it is verse 105. The translation of that verse of Yajnavalkya and the corresponding commentary of Mitakshara shows that the verse relates to eating and not to divide the property (vide Vol. 21 of the Sacred Books of the Hindus, Yajnavalkya with Mitakshara, page 227). A similar verse oceurs in Vasishta (vide Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 14, Ch. 11 or Dutt's Dharma Sastras, page 777) where also it refers to eating. It is obvious that: Jagannadha misquotes a verse of Yajnavalkya misreading the word ""bhoj"" (to eat or to feed) as ""bhaj"" (to divide) and no argument can be rested on this quotation.
he found that the expenses of the marriage might reasonably be fixed at Rs. 2,000; but on the 3rd point he held, relying on Ramalinga Annavi v. Narayana Annavi (1922) L.R. 49 I.A. 168 : I.L.R. 45 Mad. 489 : 43 M.L.J. 428 that the plaintiff was not liable to contribute out of his share towards the marriage expenses of the 1st defendant's daughters married after the date of the suit or to be married. Though the decision in Ramalinga Annavi v. Narayana Annavi (1922) L.R. 49 I.A. 168 : I.L.R. 45 Mad. 489 : 43 M.L.J. 428 (P.C.) relates to the marriage of a male coparcener, he thought that the principle applies also to the marriage of a female member. 
These four periods of partition are enumerated in Mitakshara, Chapter I, Section 2. They are referred to as showing the foundation of the liability which is shown by them to be the possession of the joint family property. During the father's lifetime if there is no partition, that the whole family is liable for the marriage of the daughters is not denied by the respondent. But he contends that such liability of the joint family during the father's lifetime was only because of the father's obligation to maintain and bear the marriage expenses of his daughters and the obligation falls upon the joint family through him, and when there is a partition it is confined to the father and his share only. It is this position which has got to be examined. If the obligation is merely that of the father and it is only through him that it falls upon the joint family, the contention of the learned Advocate for the respondent may perhaps be correct. We may examine the history of the law as to the basis of the right of the daughter to be maintained and to be married. It seems to me that so far as the joint family property is concerned, the obligation is that of all the members of the family, that is, the father and the brothers, and it is not that it was originally the obligation of the father only and through him it has extended to the whole joint family. 
We have got a series of cases to show generally that the joint family property is liable for the marriage expenses of a daughter and where the father is dead and the property has survived to the other members, whether sons or not, they are liable for the marriage expenses. (See also Strange's Hindu Law, Vol. II, page 313.) It is unnecessary to refer to these cases in detail, for it is admitted by the respondent that members of the joint family, who get the property by survivorship after the father's death, are liable for the marriage expenses of the daughters. We have, for instance, Tulsha Gopal Rai (1884) I.L.R. 6 A. 632 and Vaikuntani Ammangar v. Kallapiran Aiyangair (1900) I.L.R. 23 M. 512: 10 M.L.J. 111 where it is observed:
Lower down he refers to Mitakshara relying on a text of Gautama inferring the son's rights by birth in the (self-acquired and ancestral) properties of the father. The observations continue up to page 570 on the proper interpretation of Mitakshara.  I do not think that it can be said that Section 1 refers to the self-acquired property of the father in the modern and technical sense of, that term and that Section 5 refers to the ancestral property of the father. The object of Section 1 was to narrate the four periods of partition of a father's property, that is, the property which was held by the father whether it was self-acquired or ancestral; it refers to a case where the father was holding the property himself, that is, without being joint with other brothers.",,chedalavada subbayya,"[ 0.68038744 -0.27411142  0.44372982 -0.07192808 -0.07002646  0.01234689

Ramalinga Annavi Minor By His on 29 April 1915,1915,,Madras HC,(1916) ILR 39 Mad 587,1791536,,,4,1,0.0,"Narayana Annavi the first plaintiff is the son of Lakshmivaraha Annavi who is now deceased. The seoond and third plaintiffs are the minor sons of the first plaintiff. The first, second and third defendants are the descendants of EamaliDga Annavi, the brother of Lakshmivaraha Annavi. The fourth defendant is the first plaintiff's sister who claims to be in possession of certain properties transferred to her by her father. The plaintiffs state that those transfers are invalid and the properties still continue in the possession of the joint family. The fifth and sixth defendants are two widows of deceased co-parceners and cthey are joined as parties to the suit as provision has to be made for their maintenance.
The Subordinate Judge found that there was a partition effecting a severance of interest in respect of the debts due to the family in the year 1895--96, but the family retained its undivided status in respect of lands and houses, and that under that partition of the debts the second defendant obtained two-eighths and the balance of the debts remaining due to the family with the exception of Rs. 5,000 which was set apart for Muthuswami Annavi was equally divided between Ramalinga and Lakshmivaraha. He also found that the items of property included in the sale-deed, Exhibit III, belonged exclusively to the second defendant. The properties purchased since the partition by the family were directed to be divided between the parties in the proportions in which the debts were divided in 1895--96. The lands which were left undivided in 1895--96 were directed to be divided between the parties according to the shares to which they would be entitled under the Hindu law. He also upheld the transfers in favour of the fourth defendant. In appeal it is contended that all these findings are wrong.
The deed of gift in respect of the properties in Schedule XV(c) was executed only on the 4th November 1908. It was given to the fourth defendant by her father as her stridhanam.
The appeal is argued next against the lower Court's findings on issue No. 9 that the plaintiffs are not entitled to any amount for the expenses of the marriages of the second and third plaintiffs. 
The lower Court's decision as to the expenses of the second plaintiff's marriage accordingly cannot he sustained. They must be credited to plaintiffs in the account which will have to be taken.
As regards third plaintiff reliance is placed on Srinivasa v. Tiruvengadathiengar (1915) I.L.R. 38 Mad. 556, in which after two learned Judges had differed, a third held that the expenses of the' marriage of an unmarried co-parcener should be awarded to him or his guardian at partition. We regret that we are unable to follow this decision. It is not material that the argument in it, based on the fact that the marriage of an opposing coparcener had already been performed by the family, is not relied on here. Nor do we deal with the social considerations, which had weight with Sadasiva Ayyar, J. Nor is it necessary for us to decide, as we have been pressed to do that if provision for future marriages is obligatory it is so only between co-parceners of one generation though the references in the texts to ""brethren"" may support that conclusion. Our ground of decision is the broader one that the learned Judges, Sundara Ayyar and Spencer, JJ., who have accepted the view contended for by the plaintiffs did so on the assumption that marriage being obligatory, anticipatory, provision must necessarily be made for it at partition. That assumption appears to us unfounded.
According to findings the houses and manaikats which belonged to the family in 1895-1896 will be divided as family properties. All parties bear their own costs

Reliance in this connection was placed on several passages in Mulla's Hindu Law as well as on the decision of the Judicial Committee in the case of Rajagopala Ayyar v. Venkataraman [1947] 51 CWN 829 ; AIR 1947 PC 122, and relying on this decision, the Tribunal was of the view that the assessee was under a legal obligation to give in marriage Smt. Jayashree Mohta and the expenditure incurred therein amounted to legitimate marriage expenses on Smt. Jayashree Mohta. 
It is only for the marriage expenses of the father's daughters or sisters that provision should be made out of the joint family property. The marriage expenses of the son's daughters form only the liability of his branch and not of the whole joint family unlike the case of the father's daughters (Ramchandra v. Seeniathal ILR [1955] Mad 732).
Her marriage expenses should come out of her own father's share (Subbayya v. Ananta Ramayya [1930] ILR 53 Mad 84, 121). The same rule applies to the expenses of betrothal ceremonies of daughters.
marriage expenses when the family is joint Mulla's Hindu Law states,under the Hindu Law, a father is under no legal obligation to get his daughter married appears to have been stated too broadly. The obligation may not exist when the father is not a member of a joint family and has no ancestral property.
A debt contracted for the marriage of a coparcener or the daughter of a deceased coparcener in a joint Hindu family is a debt contracted for a family purpose and, therefore, for the benefit of the family.
It was observed that in a suit for partition, instituted by a Hindu governed by the Mitakshara law, against his father and his step-brother, the father claimed a provision for the marriage expenses of his daughters, one of whom was married subsequent to the suit and before the decree and two others Were unmarried, and the plaintiff had contended that he or his share in the family property was not liable therefore after the disruption of the coparcenary.This reference under Section 26(1) the Tribunal was right in holding that jewellery, cash and fridge of the value of Rs. 67,744 given by the assessee to Smt.

ACT:
     Indian Income Tax Act 1922-Section 10(2) (xv)-Scope of-
Retrenchment compensation  paid to  employees whose services
were  terminated-If   an  allowable   deduction-""Wholly         and
exclusively"" meaning  of-Benefit to  third  party-Whether  a
consideration for not allowing deduction.
The assessee claimed deduction under s. 10(2)(xv)  of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 of a sum of Rs. 1.64  lakhs paid by way of retrenchment compensation and compensation  for   termination         of   service        during         the assessment year 1957-58.
 the  view of the Income Tax Officer, held that the decision to  pay compensation could not be said to have been taken solely  with a view to the business requirement of the company.
 It continued to  exist as a juristic  entity and continued to function even after the transfer of its shares to Tatas. The expenditure was laid out  for the  purpose of the assessee company's own  trade and not for the trade of Tatas who were
only shareholders  of  the  company.  As  a  result  of         the expenditure the company was  benefited and  it was possible for it        to  earn  more        profits         as  a        consequence  of         the reduction in  the wage bill. It  cannot be  said that Tatas
were in any way benefited financially by reason of reduction in the consideration payable by them for the shares.
Even assuming that the motive behind the payment of retrenchment compensation was that the terms of the agreement of the sale of shares should be satisfied, as long as the amount had been laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business of the assessee, there appears to be no good reason for denying the benefit of section 10(2) (xv) of the Act to the Company if there is no other impediment to do so.
The Company is an investment company and its shares were originally held either directly or through their nominees by Sir Percival David, Lady David and Mr. V. P. David.n the nature of a capital expenditure or personal expenses of the assessee and (iii) had been laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purposes of his business, profession or vocation.
We, therefore, allow these appeals and hold that Rs. 1,27,511/- was also deductible under section 10(2)(xv) of the Act during the assessment year 1957-58 and sum of Rs. 16,885/- referred to above was allowable as a deduction during each of the three succeeding assessment years. The Department shall pay costs to the appellant. (Hearing fee one set only).compensation  for   termination         of   service        during         the assessment year 1957-58.

e Dowry Prohibition Act or under the Indian Penal Code. We are concerned with a matrimonial conduct which constitutes cruelty as a ground for dissolution of marriage.
""In matrimonial affairs we are not dealing with objective standards, it is not a matrimonial offence to fall below the standard of the reasonable man (or the reasonable woman). We are dealing with this man or this woman.""
Chandrachud, J. (as he then was) in Narayan Ganesh Dastane v. Sucheta Narayan Dastane, [1975] 3 SCR 967 (978) said:

""The Court has to deal, not with an ideal husband and an ideal wife (assuming any such exist) but with parti-
cular man and woman before it. The ideal couple or a near-ideal one will probably have no occasion to go to a matrimonial court, for, even if they may not be able to drown their differences, their ideal attitudes may help them overlook or gloss over mutual faults and failures.""
 the Parliament enacted the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (Act No. 28 of 1961). The Act prohibited the giving or taking of dowry. But in spite of this enactment, the pernicious practice continued in some communities. The Joint Committee of Parliament appointed to examine the working of the Dowry Prohibition Act remarked ""the evil sought to be done away with by the Act, on the other hand, increased by leaps and bounds and has now assumed grotesque and alarming proportions."" Again the Parliament intervened. The Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Act, 1984 was enacted with considerable changes in the parent Act. Likewise the Indian Penal Code was amended by introducing of an entirely new offence hitherto unknown to criminal jurisprudence.
Explanation-For the purposes of this section ""cruelty"" means:
(a) Any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman or
(b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.""
A new dimension has been given to the concept of cruelty. Explanation to Sec. 498 A provides that any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive a woman to commit suicide would constitute cruelty.
however, not concerned with criminal offence either under the Dowry Prohibition Act or under the Indian Penal Code. We are concerned with a matrimonial conduct which constitutes cruelty as a ground for dissolution of marriage. Such cruelty if not admitted requires to be proved on the preponderance of probabilities as in civil cases and not beyond a reasonable doubt as in criminal cases. This Court has not accepted the test of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. As said by Chandrachud, J. in Dastane case (Ibid at p. 976):

""Neither section 10 of the Act which enumerates the grounds on which a petition for judicial separation may be presented nor section 23 which governs the jurisdiction of the Court to pass a decree in any proceedings under the Act requires that the petitioner must prove his case beyond a reasonable doubt. Section 23 confers on the court the power to pass a decree if it is ""satisfied"" on matters mentioned in clauses (a) to (e) of the section. Considering that proceedings under the Act are essentially of a civil nature, the word ""satisfied"" must mean ""satisfied"" on a preponderance of ""probabilities"" and not ""satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt"". Section 23 does not alter the standard of proof in civil cases.""

JUDGMENT S.N. Aggarwal, J.
The appellant, before he was entrapped in a corruption case on 2.11.1994, was working as an
Inspector in Delhi Police and was posted as Chowki in-charge at Police Post Sarita Vihar,
New Delhi. He was accused of demanding and accepting illegal gratification of Rs.4,500/=
from the relatives. Delhi for offences under Section 7 and also under Section 13(i)(d) read
with Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and after trial was convicted
and sentenced on the said charges vide impugned judgment passed by the Special Judge,
Delhi on 10.4.2002. He was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for five years with a fine of
Rs.5,000/- for each of the offences for which he was convicted.
On 29.4.1994 Ms.Reema, daughter of PW-2 Surinder Singh, was married to Shri Mukesh,
resident of Madan Pur Khadar, New Delhi and she died an unnatural death within 4-5 months
of her marriage by strangulation in the night intervening 10/11-9-1994. Her father (PW-2) got
a criminal case registered against the husband of his deceased daughter, her father-in-law and
two sisters- in-law vide FIR no. 294/94 under Sections 498A/304B/34 IPC at Police Station
Badar Pur.
The above answer given by the deceased's father to question No. 9 during departmental
proceedings clearly implies that though he was present during raid but the formalities
regarding the preparation of papers were completed in the CBI Office and not at the spot. In
case the deceased's father was present during raid, why the prosecution withheld his presence
creates a serious doubt on the story of the prosecution. Even the presence of Constable Mool
Chand who was also a close relative of the deceased has also been established through the

testimony of PW-3, PW-5 and PW-7. The relevant portions of their testimony in their cross-
examination are extracted below:

On 2.11.94 I visited CBI office along with Jitender Kumar, UDC at around 4:00 PM pr 4:30
pm on the instructions of my senior officer. There I met some CBI officials. Complainant was
already present there and he have his name as Mool Chand.
The appellant was charge-sheeted for offences under Section 7 and also under Section
13(i)(d) read with Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act on 5.12.1995. The

prosecution examined nine witnesses and they are PW-1 Surinder Kumar (complainant); PW-
2 Surinder Singh (deceased's father); PW-3 Jitender Kumar (independent witness); PW-4 R S

Gupta (the then Additional Commissioner of Police 'examined to prove the sanction order);
PW-5 Tahir Hussain (shadow witness); PW-6 V S Bisaria, Senior Scientific Officer; PW-7
Constable Ashok Kumar [the person from whom bribe money was recovered]; PW-8 Shri
Rajiv Kumar Chadha DSP, CBI (2nd I.O. of the case); and PW-9 Shri S K Peshin, DSP, CBI
(the initial I.O. of the case).

The statement of the appellant was recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. He also examined two
witnesses in his defense and they are DW-1 Constable Vikram Singh and DW-2 Const. Ratan
Lal.
the evidence adduced by the parties, the court below found the appellant guilty of the
offences for which he was charged vide impugned judgment and order dated 10.4.2002.
Mr. Sanjay Jain, learned senior counsel, was appointed as amices Curiae to assist the court on behalf of
the appellant whereas Ms.Neelam Grover, learned Advocate, appeared on behalf of the CBI/respondent.
The evidence pointed out by the learned Counsel and the contentions raised thereon during
the course of arguments shall be dealt with at appropriate places hereinafter.
Ms.Grover relied upon a judgment of the Supreme Court in State of UP v. Zakaullah 1998
SCC (Cri) 456 in support of her contentions that conviction can be based only on the
statement of trap laying Officer de hors other evidence on record.
cases of corruption have two important aspects and they are (i) demand and (ii) acceptance.
Unless demand and acceptance of illegal gratification by the public servant charged with
under the Prevention of Corruption Act are proved by the prosecution beyond doubt, the
presumption provided for in Section 20 of the Act cannot be drawn.
he learned Senior Counsel, who appeared for the appellant, had challenged to the validity of
the sanction order passed by the sanctioning authority PW-4, Shri R S Gupta, then Addl.
Commissioner of Police, Delhi. He urged that there was complete non-application of mind on
the part of the sanctioning authority in granting the sanction for prosecution. In support of his
said contention, he placed reliance upon three judgments viz (i) Ganesh Prasad Shukla v.
State of Bihar 2000 Crl.L.J. 4841; (ii) Har Bharosey v. State of UP 1988 Crl.L.J. 1122; and
(iii) Mohd.Iqbal Ahmed v. State of AP
it may be noticed at the outset that the appellant being the Investigating Officer of a dowry
death case has heavily relied upon the fact that the relatives of the deceased in the said case
had been contacting and threatening him prior to the date of raid held on 2.11.1994 and that
he had recorded such threats in his case diary for 25.10.1995 and 29/3.10.1994 (Exhibits
DW-1/A, DW-1/B and DW-2/A respectively). The appellant has also submitted in his
defense that the father of the deceased (PW- 2) had lodged a complaint against him prior to
the date of raid in the Vigilance Department on 19.9.1994 pursuant to which a departmental
enquiry was held against him in which after enquiry he was exonerated
...In November 1994 I was investigating a criminal dowry death case bearing FIR no. 294/94,
PS Badarpur. In this case, Smt.Reema, d/o Surinder Singh PW was the deceased. The case was
registered against Mukesh and Ajit Singh, Kumari Bala and Smt.Manju (the husband, father in
law and sisters in laws of the deceased). I had arrested Mukesh and Ajit Singh, However, the
two ladies, Kumari Bala and Smt.Manju had applied for anticipatory bail. Surinder Singh,
father of the deceased PW went to the court of ACMM and made allegations against me that I
was colluding with the accused persons of dowry death case and the Hon'ble Court recorded
the statement of Surinder Singh and his family members.
One Mool Chand Ct., of Delhi Police is related and known person to Surinder Singh and
Surinder Kumar, PWs. Mool Chand is not an authorised person

On 29.9.1994 the said Mool Chand Const., Surinder Singh and Surinder Kumar came to the
Police Post and had threatened me that if I failed to show the return of the dowry articles, they
will not allow me to remain in service. I recorded the threat in the case diary dated 29.10.1994.
Such threats were also extended to me on 25.10.1994 and I recorded the said threat in my case
diary on 25.10.1994. I also recorded the threats in daily diary dated 29/30.10.1994 of PP Sarita
Vihar.
19. The above statement of the appellant clearly indicates that prior to the date raid was held
on 2.11.1994, the relatives of the deceased had extended threats to the appellant which was
recorded by him in his case dairy of 25.10.1994 and 29/30.10.1994. The case diaries containing
the threats have been proved by DW-1 and DW-2 as documents Exhibit DW-1/A, DW-1/B and
DW-2/A.
dowry death case, is shown to have recorded inter alia that outside the Court, Const. Mool
Chand and some of his relatives had demanded early restoration of dowry or else they would
take suitable action against him Ex. DW1/B. Similarly inter alia also refers to Const. Mool
Chand and his relative Surinder Singh (PW-2) having met again outside the Court and having
threatened to make a complaint against him before superior officers.
case diary Exhibits DW-1/A, DW-1/B and DW-2/A and in this regard it would be necessary
to quote the observations and findings of the court below on this aspect contained in paras 77,
78 and 98 to 102 of the impugned judgment and the same are reproduced hereinbelow.
PW-1 conceded during cross examination that he accompanied by PW-2 had visited and met
the accused at PP on 29-30/09/94. He further denied the suggestion that similar threat was
given by him and others to the accused on 25.10.1994 and 29.10.1994. He stated that he
would not know if accused had made any entry with regard to such threats in the case diary or
DD of P.S. Similar suggestions about threats extended on 29-30.09.94, 25.10.94 and 29.10.94
have also been given to PW-2,
the case diary and daily diary through DW-1 and DW-2. DW-1 Const. Vikram Singh Proved
the case diary no. 20 and 21 Ex. DW1/A and Ex. DW1/B pertaining to the dowry death case
referred to earlier.
the accused as to what had transpired in the Court on 29.10.94. Said entry no where alleges
any threats having been extended.
Interestingly, the date and place of occurrence mentioned in the said case diary is described
as 10.11.94, even though the case diaries purport to have been recorded on 25.10.94 and
29.10.94.
It is inconceivable that a police officer of the rank of Inspector would sit quiet even on
hearing threats from a police official of as low a rank as a Constable.
the accused has himself not entered the witness box to vouch safe the acts pertaining to
alleged threats received by him on 25.10.94 and 29.10.94. 102 All said and done, I am of the
considered opinion that the theory of threats by the Complainant side has been invented on
the basis of record that has been fabricated. In these circumstances Chander Bhan v. Stated
(as relied upon by defense) is distinguishable on facts.
The Apex Court in the case of Rabindra Kumar Dey v. State of Orissa had observed as under.

It is true that under Section 105 of the Evidence Act the onus of proving exceptions
mentioned in the Indian Penal Code lies on the accused.The Evidence Act does not
contemplate that the accused should prove his case with the same strictness and rigour as the
Prosecution is required to prove a criminal charge. the standard of preponderance of
probabilities as envisaged by Section 5 of the Evidence. prove his case or to prove the
exceptions of the Indian Penal Code on which he seeks to rely. \
the case diary, Exhibits DW-1/A, DW-1/B and DW-2/A, on the premise that the appellant
himself did not enter the witness box. Such an approach was wholly erroneous in view of the
admission made by the relatives of the deceased (PW-1 and PW-2). the date raid was held on
2.11.1994. Further more, the view taken by the learned trial court that the entries contained in
the case diaries, Exhibits DW-1/A, DW-1/B and DW-2/A, are fabricated documents only
because the date of 10.11.1994 is mentioned there in the column of date of incident. This date
of 10.11.194 mentioned in the above mentioned case diaries actually relates. the month of

November instead of September mentioned in the said case diaries was on account of pen-
slip. the month of November instead of September mentioned in the said case diaries was on

account of pen-slip.
PW-1 Surinder Kumar, is the 'Mausa' of the deceased and PW-2 Surinder Singh, is the
deceased's father. the investigation on several dates prior to the date raid was held on
2.11.1994. PW-1 and PW-2 have further admitted in their evidence that they had lodged a
complaint against the appellant on 19.9.1994. The complaint dated 19.9.1994 made by the
deceased's father (PW-2) against the appellant in the Vigilance Department of Delhi Police
through Commissioner of Police is Exhibit as PW-2/D-2. This complaint admittedly was
made before the date of raid i.e. 2.11.1994.
the written complaint made by PW-2, Exhibit PW-2/D-2, It is revealed from the record that
the independent public witnesses associated with the raid have not supported the prosecution
version. These public witnesses are PW-3 Jitender Kumar and PW-5 Tahir Hussain. They
both were declared hostile.
Constable Ashok Kumar was caught red handed during raid and as per the prosecution case,
the tainted money was allegedly recovered from his possession. The observation that these
public witnesses were won over by the appellant does not seem to be correct in view of
testimony of other witnesses on record. PW-7 Constable Ashok Kumar was initially a suspect
but later on the prosecution chose to make him its witness instead of putting him in the
column of accused persons. No effort was made by the prosecution to dig out the truth from
him or to know how the tainted money came in his possession.
S.K. Peshin who was the trap laying officer was admittedly neither a witness to the demand
of bribe allegedly made by the appellant at Patiala House Courts or to the acceptance of the
bribe money by him. The tainted money was admittedly not recovered during raid from the
possession of the appellant. PW-9 S.K. Peshin who was the trap laying officer was admittedly
neither a witness to the demand of bribe allegedly made by the appellant from the relatives of
the deceased at Patiala House Courts on 02.11.94 or to the acceptance of the bribe money by
him.
In Jaswant Singh v.State of Punjab Air 1973 SC 707 it was held by the Supreme Court that in
a bribery case the complainant is an interested witness and his evidence must be considered

with great caution and it can be accepted when this is corroborated by other evidence
adduced by the prosecution.
In view of the latest trend of the Supreme Court in its judgments particularly in State of UP v.
Zakaullah's case (supra), the complainant's evidence does not require any corroboration and
the court can act upon the testimony of the complainant provided the same is trustworthy to
be acted upon.
The testimony of PW-1 and PW-2 being relatives of the deceased is credit-worthy or not, the
Supreme Court of India has ruled.
Surinder Singh is the father of the deceased Reema. It was contended that even the tainted
money was kept in the drawer of the appellant by Constable Mool Chand but for reasons best
known to the prosecution, their presence during raid was concealed from the Court.
A bare look to the above testimony of PW-3, PW-5 and PW-7 would show presence of
Constable Mool Chand at the time of raid beyond doubt. Admittedly the drawer of the table
in which the tainted money was kept was unlocked. If presence is established beyond doubt,
then why was prosecution withheld from making Constable Chand a witness? The
prosecution has not proved that it was not possible for a third person to go and keep the
tainted money in the unlocked drawer. The absence of inner room in site plan Ex.PW-3/A
completely belies the testimony of PW-1 about any such conversation relating to reduction of
the amount of bribe money.

202Nd Report On Proposal To Amend Section 304Bof The Indian Penal Code

LAW COMMISSION OF INDIA
 TWO HUNDRED AND SECOND REPORT ON PROPOSAL TO AMEND SECTION 304-B OF INDIAN PENAL CODE.
 October, 2007 2, The proposal to amend Section 304-B, IndianPenal Code, 1860 dealing with the offences of dowry death has been presented to the Law Commission. The question that has been examined by the LawCommission should be amended to provide for more stringentpunishment of death sentence to curb the menace of dowries deaths.
 Dear Dr. Bhardwaj,
 I have great pleasure in presenting the 202nd Report of theLaw Commission on the proposal to amend Section 304-B, IndianPenal Code, 1860 dealing with the offences of dowry death. The question that has been examined by the LawCommission in this Report is whether Section should be amended to provide for more stringentpunishment of death sentence to curb the menace of dowry deaths.
While dealing with the subject, the Commission had to choose between two options available to it. The first was to comprehensively examine the subject of dowry death in all itsrelated aspects such as definition of dowry administration andenforcement of the legal regulation, and accountability of theconcerned agencies etc. and thereby endeavour to codify afresh thelaw on dowry death in its entirety. The second was to confine itsconsideration only to the point referred to it i.e. whether Section304-B be amended to provide for death sentence?
The Commission examined Section 304-B IPC in the light of various judicial pronouncements. The Commission finds that the offence of murder is not the same thing as dowry death. The presumptive character of the offence and cardinal principle ofproportionality go against the proposed prescription of death sentence in case ofdowry death, it says. The Commission found a lot of misgivings and misapprehension associated with the subject of dowry death. Dowry death is quiteoften confused with the offence of murder. The Commission felt the finer nuances need to be speltout clearly for their better understanding and appreciation.
Section 304B of Indian PenalCode, 1860, should be amended to provide formore stringent punishment of death sentence in order to curb the menace of dowry deaths. The question of ""Dowry Deaths and Law Reforms"" was suo motu taken up earlier by the LawCommission in its 91st Report. The offence of dowry death has been created in Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The section provides forpunishment of imprisonment for a term which shall not be lessthan seven years but which may extend to imprisonment forlife. Besides, Section 113A wasinserted in the Indian Evidence Act in 1983 providing forpresumption as to abetment of suicide by a married woman if the conditions specified in that section are satisfied. Beforedealing with these conflicting views, it may be expedient tostate as to how this matter has come up before the Commission.
The death of Urmila Devi was due to asphyxia as a result of ante mortem strangulation. Judge: ""In my opiniondowry death is worse than murder but surprisingly there is nodeath penalty for it whereas death penalty can be given formurder"". This matter has come up for consideration of theCommission pursuant to the Order dated 31st January, 2003 ofAllahabad High Court in Criminal Bail Application No.12466of 2002 in the case of Natthu Vs State of U.P. They did not allowUrmila to visit her parental house until motorcycle was givenand when Ramveer, brother of Urmila, went to fetch her, theythreatened to beat him and told him that Urmila would be senton giving of a motorcycle. The punishment for the offence of dowry death is imprisonment for not less than seven years that may extend to life imprisonment.
If all the conditions stated above are present, then the husband or the relative concerned shallbe deemed to have caused her death and such death will be called dowry death. If there is evidence that the accused committed the murder of woman in terms of Section 300 defining the offence of murder, he will be charged with the commission of the offence and liable to beproceeded against accordingly. If the conditions of Section304B or, for that matter, any other section of the Penal Code arepresent in such a case, the accused will be charge with thecommission of that offence also. The Commission will considerin the succeeding chapters whether there is any warrantfor appending capital punishment to Section 304B.
Dowry is a deep-rooted social evil which has become bane for our society. It is the cause of atrocity on woman and many unfortunate deaths of young ladies. The offenders of death relating to demand of dowry always tries to give an impression that to be a suicidal or accidental death, but it is always the bride who meets with the accident. In Soni Devrabhai Babubhai Vs State of Gujarat and Others, (1991) 4 SCC 298, the Supreme Court observed: Section 304B of the India Penal Code and the cognate provisions are meant for eradication of the social evil of dowry. The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 was enacted for this purpose. Report of the Joint Committee of Parliament quoted the observations of Jawaharlal Nehru to indicate the role of legislation in dealing with the 'social evil'.
The enactment of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, in its original form was found inadequate. The demand of dowry and the mode of its recovery take different forms to achieve the same result. This experience has led to several other legislative measures to combat this evil. (Paras 5 and 6 at pp.300-301).
In 1961, the Dowry Prohibition Act (Act 28 of 1961) was passed prohibiting taking or giving dowry. A new offence of cruelty, which provides for punishment to the husband or relatives if they harass the women with a view to coerce her to meet any unlawful demand for property, has been introduced in the Penal Code. Section 174 Cr.PC was also amended to secure Post Mortem in case of suicide or death of a woman within seven years of her marriage.
By the Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Act 1983 (Act 46 of 1983) Chapter XXA was introduced in the Penal Code with Section 498A, creating a new offence of cruelty, which provides for punishment to the husband or relatives if they harass the women with a view to coerce her to meet any unlawful demand for property. The relevant G.S.R. reads:. Dowry is defined in the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 as ""any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly"" by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage. Whoever commits dowry death will be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than seven years but which may extend to imprisonment for life. Dowry death is caused by cruelty or harassment by a husband or any relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called ""dowry death"".
A demand for money on account of some financial stringency or for meeting some urgent domestic expenses or for purchasing manure cannot be termed a demand for dowry as the said word is normally understood. Dowry is a fairly well known social custom or practice in India. The giving or taking of property or valuable security must have some connection with the marriage of the parties. (See Union of India Vs Garware Nylons Ltd. AIR 1996 SC 3509 and Chemicals and Fibres of India Vs Union of India AIR 1997 SC 558). The dowry mentioned in Section 304-B should be any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given in connection with the marriage. There can be many other instances for payment of money or giving property as between the spouses. It is not enough that harassment or cruelty was caused to the woman with a demand for dowry at some time, but it should have happened ""soon before her death"".
Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code is a substantive provision creating a new offence of dowry death. The offence under Section 304B is punishable with a minimum sentence of seven years which may extend to life imprisonment and is triable by a Court of Sessions. The corresponding amendments made in the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Evidence Act relate to the trial and proof of offence. Section 304B is a substantive provision creating a new offence. The need of the hour is to fight this menace of dowry in the best possible way. There is an argument within the law making agency that whether introduction of capital sentence for the offenders for causing dowry death would meet the ends of justice. In India there is a subtle shift from the capital punishment to imprisonment for life and death sentence awarded only for the rarest of the rare cases.
Section 121 - Waging or attempting to wage war, or abetting the waging of war, against Government of India. Section 302 - Murder. Section 364A - Kidnapping for ransom, etc. Section 396 - Murder in dacoity article 21 of the Constitution of India I.P.C prescribe Capital Punishment. (8) Section 364A - Kidnapping for ransom, etc.
A law which imprisons for rape and robbery and hangs for murder, holds out to ravishers and robbers a strong inducement to spare the lives of those whom they have injured. If the punishment of the crime which he has already committed is exactly the same as that of murder, he will have no restraining motive to follow up his crime with a murder, the Supreme Court has observed. Section 361 of the 1973 Code re-enacts Section 562 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 (in short ""the old Code""). Section 361 makes it mandatory for the court to record ""special reasons"" for not applying the provisions of Section 360. This is some indication by the legislature that reformation and rehabilitation of offenders are now among the foremost objects of the administration of criminal justice in Nigeria.
2.7.3. The Hon'ble Supreme Court further observed:""It should be borne in mind that before the amendment of Section 367(5) of the old Code, by the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, 1955 (26 of 1955) which came into force on 1.1.1956, on a conviction for an offence punishable with death, if the court sentenced the accused to any punishment other than death, the reason why sentence of death was not passed had to be stated in the judgment. The amendment of Section 367(5) of the old Code, by the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, 1955 (26 of 1955) came into force on 1.1.1956. The court must take into account all the circumstances, and state its reasons for whichever of the two sentences it imposes in its discretion, the Supreme Court has observed. Section 354(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 marks a significant shift in the legislative policy underlying the old Code as in force immediately before 1.4.1974. This amendment relates to procedure and now courts are no longer required to elaborate the reasons for not awarding the death penalty; but they cannot depart from sound judicial considerations preferring the lesser punishment. The section includes a sub-section (3) which reads as under: When the conviction is for an offence punishable with death or, in the alternative, with imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of years, the judgment shall state the reason for the sentence awarded, and the special reason for such sentence. The normal punishment for murder is imprisonment for life and death penalty is an exception. Courts are no longer required to elaborate the reasons for not awarding the death penalty; but they cannot depart from sound judicial considerations preferring the lesser punishment. In cases of murder, however, since the choice is between capital punishment and life imprisonment the legislature has provided a guideline in the form of sub-section (3) .
In case the judge awards the death penalty, ""special reasons"" for such sentence shall be stated in the judgment. When the law casts a duty on the judge to state reasons it follows that he is under a legal obligation to explain his choice of the sentence. The existence of the 'special reasons clause' in the above provision implies that the court can in fit cases impose the extreme penalty of death. Section 235 Section 235 of the Penal Code provides that if an accused is convicted, unless he proceeds in accordance with the provisions of Section 360, the judge must hear the accused on the question of sentence, and then pass sentence on him according to law. There are only a few cases where a minimum punishment is prescribed. The choice of the punishment is left to the discretion of the judge.
2.7.5 It serves a threefold purposes (i) punitive; (ii) deterrent; and (iii) protective. The death sentence is reserved for exceptional cases in which the crime is so brutal, diabolical and revolting as to shock the collective conscience of the community. Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception, as given in Machhi Singh case (1983) 3SCC 470 at p. 489. The extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted except in gravest cases of extreme culpability. A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up before the option is exercised.
The community may entertain such sentiment in the following circumstances as observed by the Supreme Court in Lehna Singh case (supra, at p. 86, paras 23-24):. When murder is committed in an extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical, revolting, or dastardly manner so as to arouse intense and extreme indignation of the community. When murder of a member of a Scheduled Caste or minority community etc. is committed not for personal reasons but in circumstances which arouse social wrath, or in cases of 'bride burning' or 'dowry deaths'. There are a number of cases in India where the Supreme Court has commuted capital punishment to life imprisonment. The court observed that death penalty may be given only in the rarest of rare cases where aggravating circumstances are such that the extreme penalty meets the ends of justice. These include murders committed by persons of a particular caste, community, or locality.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that it will not be safe to impose extreme penalty of death in a conviction based on the deposition of a child. In Suresh Vs State of U.P., 2001 Cr. L.J. 1462 (SC), an extreme sentence of death was affirmed and commuted to life imprisonment. The Hon'ble Supreme Court while commuting the death sentence to life imprisonment for life of Gurnam Singh and Anr. Vs State of Punjab (1998) 7 SCC 722 has said that it would serve the ends of justice if the capital punishment was commuted into life imprisonment.
The Supreme Court of India has ruled that a sentence of imprisonment for life does not automatically expire at the end of 20 years of imprisonment including remission, unless the appropriate Government chooses to exercise its discretion to remit either the whole or part of the sentence. The Constitution bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the imprisonment of life is not for any definite period. Section 61 of the Indian Penal Code (IPCC) provides that a life convict can be said to have acquired a right to have his case put up by the prison authorities in time to the State Government for consideration for premature release. Sub-rules do not provide for automatic release after he has completed 20 years of the detention including remission.
In Ravindra Trimbak Chouthmal Vs State of Maharashtra, (1996) 4 SCC 148, Hon'ble Supreme Court commuted the sentence of death to imprisonment for life and further ordered that sentence passed under Section 201 to run not concurrently but consecutively: The sentence was handed out because of the atrocious way in which the head was severed and the body was cut in nine pieces. But then, it is a fit case, according to us, where, for the offence under Sections 201/34, the sentence awarded, which is RI for seven years being the maximum for a case of the present type, should be sustained, in view of what had been done to cause disappearance of the evidence relating to the commission of murder - the atrocious way in which the head was severed and the body was cut in nine pieces.
Section 304B and Section 302 of the Evidence Act are clearly distinguishable. The court before framing of the charges should see and analyze that whether charge can be framed against the accused under Section 302 or not. In Hemchand Vs State of Haryana, 1994 (6) SCC 727, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that Section 113B of the evidence Act says that when the question is whether a person has committed a dowry death of a woman and it is shown that soon before her death, such woman has been subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment for, or in connection with any demand for dowry, the court shall presume that such person had caused the victim's death. Motive for a murder may or may not be individual, but in dowry deaths, it is inherent. The absence of direct connection of the accused with death has to be taken into consideration in balancing the sentence to be awarded to the accused. Sections 221 and 222 of the Code are the two provisions dealing with the power of a criminal court to convict the accused of an offence which is not included in the charge.
Section 222(1) of the Code deals with a case ""when a person is charged with an offence consisting of several particulars"" The Section permits the court to convict the accused ""of the minor offence, though he was not charged with it"". Only if the two offences are cognate offences, wherein the main ingredients are common, the one punishable among them with a lesser sentence can be regarded as minor offence. Nonetheless, all other ingredients necessary for the offence under Section 304-B IPC would stand established. 17. The composition of the offence under Section 304-B IPC is vastly different from the formation of the offence of murder under Section 302 IPC and hence the former cannot be regarded as minor offence vis-à-vis the latter. However, the position would be different when the charge also contains the offence under Section 498-A IPC (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty). If a prosecution failed to establish the offence under Section 302 IPC, which alone was included in the charge, it is permissible for the court to convict the accused of the other offence, a two-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court has ruled. The crux of the matter is this: Would there be occasion for a failure of justice by adopting such a course as to convict an accused of offences under Section 304-B IPC when all the ingredients necessary for the said offence have come out in evidence, although he was not charged with the offence?
Section 304-B has been brought on the statute-book on 9-11-1986 as a package along with Section 113-B of the Evidence Act. The court has no option but to presume that the accused had caused dowry death unless the accused disproves it, which is a statutory compulsion on the court. But by the introduction of Section 113-A in the Evidence Act the said offence under Section 306 IPC has acquired wider dimensions and has become a serious marriage-related offence. 30. But the peculiar situation in respect of an offence under Section 304-B IPC, as discernible from the distinction pointed out above in respect of the offence under Section 306 IPC is this: Under Section 304-B IPC the court has a statutory compulsion, merely on the establishment of two factual positions enumerated above, to presume that the accused has committed dowry death. If any accused wants to escape from the said catch the burden is on him to disprove it and if he fails to do so the court is bound to act on it. 31. Now take the case of an accused who was called upon to defend only a charge under Section 302 IPC.
If an accused was only asked to defend a charge under Section 302 IPC and was alternatively convicted under Section 304-B IPC without any notice to him, the court has to call upon the accused to enter on his defence in respect of the said offence. Without affording such an opportunity to the accused, a conviction would lead to real and serious miscarriage of justice. In Shanti Vs State of Haryana 1991(1) SCC 371, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that Section 304B and 498A are not mutually exclusive. They deal with two distinct offences. If the case is established against the accused he can be convicted under both the Sections.
Theories of criminality have a two-fold purpose: they help to organize existing information about criminal behaviour into a coherent, systematic framework, and they point out directions for further research. Criminology and Crime An Introduction by Harold J. Vetter and Ira J. Silverman (1986) p. 235. The criminal is viewed in two diametrically opposed perspectives and is meted out different treatment in each of these two approaches. The punitive approach deals with the criminal being viewed as a bad guy and punishment is inflicted on the offender as retribution and to protect the society from crimes. There are other theories which deal with the factors that lead one to commit a crime and focus on the removal of such factors with a view to prevent commission of crimes.
Section 304B of Indian Penal Code, 1860 should be amended to provide for death sentence for offence of dowry death. Some of these are corporal punishment, fines, forfeiture and confiscation of properties, banishment, externment, imprisonment, capital punishment or death sentence, corrective labour, public censure, etc. The Committee found that because of the above said discrepancies in the provision the law has failed in its objective. The minimum punishment should be increased from seven to ten years. Also the time limit of presumption may be increased because seven years is very short a time and often the offence is executed in a preplaned manner.
India's Supreme Court has ruled that death penalty per se isn't unconstitutional, although some of the modes of carrying out the same may be otherwise. 3.5.4. Some of the famous Abolitionists like Montesquieu, Voltaire, Beccaria, etc. have argued that since the penalty is irrevocable, it should not be resorted to. (See Jagmohan Singh Vs State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1973 SC 947; Rajendra Prasad Vs State of Uttar Pradesh AIR 1979 SC 916; Bachan Singh Vs State of Punjab AIR 1980 SC 898; Machhi Singh Vs State of Punjab AIR 1983 SC 957)
The Commission did not recommend that any other offences under the Indian Penal Code or any other law should be punishable with death (Para 3(b) of Summary of Main Conclusions and Recommendation at p.356). The Commission, inter alia, observed that where an act of adulteration or arson causes death and the conditions of Section 300 on murder, particularly as to mens rea, are satisfied the case could be dealt with under Section 300/302, IPC. If the conditions of murder in Section 300 are satisfied, the offender can certainly be awarded death sentence under Section 302 as per the norms laid down by the apex court in various cases. If not, then making dowry related death as a capital offence may not be in symmetry with the schemes of the Indian Penal Code. It may be noted that even before insertion of Section 304B on dowry death in 1984, there have been cases of dowry deaths which were prosecuted for murder under Section 300, IPC.
The Supreme Court modified the death sentence to life imprisonment in view of the two opinions of the Courts below as to the guilt of the accused. Smt. Lichhamadevi Vs State of Rajasthan AIR 1988 SC 1785 was another case of dowry death. AIR 1988 SC 1785 was another case of dowry death that arose before the insertion of Section 304B in the Indian Penal Code. The decision to award death sentence is more out of anger than on reasons. The Judicial discretion should not be allowed to be swayed by emotions and indignation. There must have been other persons also who have combined and conspired together and committed the murder. Under Section 302 IPC, a husband could be prosecuted for unnatural death if both accident and suicide could be excluded on facts. 3.6.5 Panakanti Sampath Rao Vs State of A.P., (2006) 9 SCC 658 is a case where the accused was charged with commission of offences under Sections 498A, 302 and 304B IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.
3.6.7 State of U.P. Vs Ashok Kumar Srivastava, AIR 1992 SC 840 is another case of bride burning for dowry wherein a young woman aged about 25 years died of burns within less than a year of her marriage. The Supreme Court has restored the order of conviction and sentence passed by the trial court in a case of bride burning for dowry. The three accused were charged and convicted under Section 302/34 IPC but the High Court acquitted the accused as the trustworthiness of some of the prosecution witnesses was suspected. 3.6.8 The curse of dowry claimed another victim in Kundula Bale Subrahmanyam Vs State of A.P. (1993) 2 SCC 684 wherein the husband and mother-in-law of the deceased Kundula Koti Nagbani were convicted under Sections 302/34 IPC and sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life. Though ordinarily the Supreme Court is slow to interfere in an acquittal while exercising power under article 136 but in this case the apex court found that the approach of the High Court had resulted in gross miscarriage of justice. There is a growing cult of violence and exploitation of the young brides, though keeps on sending shock waves to the civilized society whenever it happens, continues unabated. Lack of education and economic dependence of women have encouraged the perpetrators of the crime. In many cases, it has been noticed that husband, even after marriage continues to be 'Mamma's baby' and the umbilical cord appears not to have been cut even at that stage.been noticed that husband, even after marriage continues to be 'Mamma's baby' and the umbilical cord appears not to have been cut even at that stage.
The Dowry Prohibition Act was enacted in 1961 and has been amended from time to time, but this piece of social legislation, keeping in view the growing menace of the social evil, also does not appear to have served much purpose. Laws are not enough to combat is evil. A wider social movement of educating women of their rights, to conquer the menace, is what is needed more particularly in rural areas. (See in Kundula Bale Subrahmanyam Vs State of A.P. (1993) 2 SCC 684). In Kailash Kaur Vs State of Punjab (1987) 2 SCC 631, Avtar Singh, the husband of Amandeep Kaur, was put in trial under Section 302 for setting his wife's body on fire. On appeal, the High Court acquitted the husband giving him the benefit of doubt, but convicted Kailash and Mahinder Kaur and sentenced them to life imprisonment. When the matter came up before the Supreme court, it said, ""we have very grave doubts about the legality, propriety and correctness of the decision of High Court"".
The Supreme Court of India (SCC) in unequivocal terms has commended death sentence to perpetrators of ""gruesome murder of young wives"" as the culmination of a long process of physical and mental harassment and torture for extraction of dowry. The Court felt that in such cases the collective conscience of the community is so shocked that it will expect the holders of the judicial power centre to inflict death penalty. (SCC pp. 487-88, paras 32 and 35). A three Judge Bench of the Court speaking through Thakkar, J. in Machhi Singh Vs State of Punjab, (1983) 3 SCC 470; 1983 SCC (Cri.) 681, had clearly enunciated various circumstances which could be treated as 'rarest of the rare' cases in which the accused convicted under Section 302, IPC must be punished with death sentence.
Section 498-A, IPC and amendments to the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 are distinct offences under Indian Penal Code, 1860. The Supreme Court observed that a person can be convicted under more than one Section if the conditions of the charged Sections are satisfied in a given case. Offences under different Sections of the Indian Penal Code,1860 are distinct offences. Thus, in Ravindra Trimbak Chouthmal Vs Stat of Maharashtra (1996) 4 SCC 148, a case of dowry death, the accused husband was charged and convicted by trial court under Section 302 read with Section 120B, IPC for committing murder of his wife Vijaya. Dowry deaths are blood-boiling, as human blood is spilled to satisfy raw greed, naked greed; a greed which has no limit. We, therefore, resist ourselves from upholding the death sentence, much though we would have desired annihilation of a despicable character like the appellant before us.
The offence of murder is not the same thing as the offence of dowry death under Section 304B though death of bride may be a common element in both the offences. The absence of direct connection between the husband and the death of wife distinguished offence of dowry death from that of murder, the Supreme Court has held. After quoting Section 304B, the Supreme Court observed: Furthermore, even if accusation under Section 304 B fails, a person can be convicted under Section 498A notwithstanding that cruelty is common essential to both the Sections. A reading of Section 304B, IPC would show that when a question arises whether a person has committed the offence of dowry death of a woman what all that is necessary is it should be shown that soon before her unnatural death, which took place within seven years of marriage, the deceased was subjected to cruelty or harassment for or in connection with demand for dowry. There is a presumption under Section 113B of the Evidence Act as to the dowry death. It can, therefore, be seen that irrespective of the fact whether such person is directly responsible for the death of the deceased or not, he is deemed to have committed the offence.
The offence of dowry death in Section 304B, IPC does not fall into the categories of offences for which death penalty has been provided in the Penal Code. Dowry death per se does not involve the direct connection between the accused and the offence because of its presumptive character. The recommendations of the National Commission for Women are already before the Government. In the US Supreme Court, Justice Thurgood Marshall McLaurin writes: ""The principle of proportion between crime and punishment is a principle of just desert that serves as the foundation of every criminal sentence that is justifiable"". He argues that in practice sentences are determined largely by other considerations. Sometimes it is the correctional needs of the perpetrator that are offered to justify a sentence.
Dowry death is equally a matter of concern for the society as a whole and should be looked upon contemptuously both on the giver and the taker. The Courts cannot allow an emotional and sentimental feeling to come into the judicial pronouncements. There should be no hostile atmosphere against an accused in court. A hostile atmosphere is bound to interfere in an unbiased approach as well as a decision. This has to be avoided at all costs. It is the obligation of every court to find out the truth and act according to law once the truth is discovered. In that search for truth obviously the Court has to function within the bounds set by law. What happens outside the Court room when the Court is busy in its process of adjudication is indeed irrelevant. Unless a proper cushion is provided to keep the proceedings within the court room dissociated from the heat generated through the news media or through flutter in the public mind, the cause of justice is bound to suffer.
There is no necessity to prescribe capital punishment for offence committed under Section 304B (dowry death) of the Indian Penal Code, the Supreme Court has said. The court does not recommend amendment of Section 304-B to provide for death sentence as the maximum punishment in the case of a dowry death. Dowry deaths are manifestation of socio-economic malady prevailing in the society. This has to be addressed at different levels so as to curb the menace of dowry deaths and not at the legal redressal level alone. We will, however, refrain ourselves from entering into this arena as this does not strictly belong to legal realm.

JUDGMENT K.S. Garewal, J.
Kuldip Singh and his parents Balwant Singh and Gurmit Kaur of Lachowal were found guilty
for offence under Section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code in 1993. Feeling aggrieved they have
come up in appeal. Niranjan Dass (P.W.-2) who was the complainant in the case has fried
criminal revision for enhancement of sentence which is Criminal Revision No. 156 of 1993.
Resham Kaur alias Paramjit Kaur died on January 6, 1992. She had been married to Kuldip
Singh of Lachowal three years before her death. Her father Naranjan Dass suspected foul
play and reported the matter to the police. ASI Sucha Singh (RW.-4) found the dead body
lying in the Baithak of the house of the appellant.
The appellants pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Prosecution examined Dr. Gurdev
Singh (P.W.-1), Naranjan Dass (PW.-2), Gurdial Singh (P.W.-3), ASI Sucha Singh (P.W.-4)
and Draftsman Paramjit Singh (P.W.-5). My parents live in village Lachowal and I and my
wife only occasionally used to go to Lachowal. At the trial charge was framed against the
appellants under Section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code to which they pleaded not guilty
and claimed to be tried. I was living with my wife at Hoshiarpur as I am serving at
'Lachhman Kohlu Ghar'.
The learned trial Judge commenced the consideration of the facts of the case by recounting
the provisions of Section 304-B, I.P.C., Section 113B of the Evidence Act and Section 498-A
of the Indian Penal Code. The learned Judge concluded that the deceased had died of
aluminium phosphide poisoning within three years of her marriage. The learned Judge was
seemingly conscious of the various ingredients of the provisions relating to dowry death,
therefore, he should have examined the evidence of the prosecution with regard to cruelty or
harassment meted out to the deceased in connection with demand for dowry. Learned
Counsel for the appellants has argued that the learned Trial Court has overlooked the
surrounding circumstances and probabilities of the case. The testimony of Naranjan Dass was
examined but not in the manner in which the evidence should be examined in dowry death
cases.
The absence or lack of evidence against Balwant Singh and Gurmeet Kaur was completely
overlooked. All the instances of so called dowry demands and maltreatment were at least 2
years old, therefore, it could not be said that the deceased had been subjected to cruelty or
harassment soon before her death. Dowry death cases are a phenomenon peculiar to our
country. This gives rise to cases under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code and/or Section
406, I.P.C.
From marriage to dowry death there would usually be a well chronicled account of the events
touching of the husband-wife relationship or the wife and parents-in-law relationship.
Modern life puts all kinds of pressures on the husband/wife relationship and often it is the
upbringing and background of the parties which plays a prominent part. The Investigator
must act impartially and not as a biased or a sided inquirer. Naranjan Dass runs a

confectionery shop/tea stall at Ravi Dass Nagar near D.A.V. College, Hoshiarpur. Kuldip
Singh demanded money for going abroad and asked for Rs. 1,000 after six months of
marriage. Resham Kaur died on January 6, 1992 which means that she was married three
years prior to her death.
In Pawan Kumar v. State of Haryana, II (1998) SLT 525=1 (1998) DMC 165 (SC)=I (1998)
CCR 365 (SC)=AIR 1998 SC 958 the Supreme Court cautioned as under:""This places an
arduous duty on the Court to separate such individuals from the offenders. In Pawan Kumar
v. State of Haryana, II (1998) SLT 525=1 (SC), the Supreme Court cautioned as under:""This
places an arduous duty on the Court to separate such individuals from the offenders"". No
convincing evidence has been led that the deceased was subjected to cruelty by appellant
Nos. 2 and 3. Hence on the evidence on record, so far as appellant Nos. 2 and 3 are
concerned, we extend to them the benefit of doubt and acquit them.""
Supreme Court in Satbir Singh v. State of Punjab, II (2001), DMC 734=VI (2001) SLT 803-
IV (SC) CCR 75 (SC)=AIR 2001 SC 2828 laid down as under;It is not enough that
harassment or cruelty was caused to the woman with a demand for dowry at some time, if
Section 304B is to be invoked. But it should have happened soon before her death. 17. In
Mungeshwar Prasad Chaurasia v. State of Bihar, I (2002) DMC 480 (SC)=II (2002) SLT
81=I (2002) CCR 176 (SC)=2002(1) RCR (Criminal) 621 (SC) the following observations
were made:""All of them said in one accord that husband of Sudama Devi demanded dowry a
few months prior to her death.
The present case illustrates how a suicide simpliciter got converted into a case of dowry death
by introducing a few irrelevant demands of money from his father-in-law. There is no
evidence that the appellant had driven her to suicide by making a dowry demand of the type
mentioned in Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code. To record conviction there has to be
harassment and cruelty in connection with a demand for dowry made soon before the death of
the deceased under unnatural circumstances. Unless all ingredients are present, the offence
of dowry death punishable under Section 304-B of the India Penal Code would not be made
out.
in view of the above discussion, this appeal is accepted and the appellants are hereby
acquitted.
Criminal Revision No. 156 of 1993 is also dismissed.

The following accused appellants have preferred the appeal No. 125/97 against the judgment
and order dated 24-2-1997 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Jalore in Sessions Case No.
25/93. Arivind Kumar (Husband of deceased), Sanwal Sanwal Chand (father-in-law of rigorous
deceased) and Chetal Lal (Jeth of deceased) are listed for hearing.
Arvind Kumar and Ors. vs The State Of Rajasthan on 26 April, 2001. She was married
to accused appellant No. 1 Arvind Kumar S/o Sanwal Chand, resident of village Silason.
After usual investigation, police submitted challan against the accused appellants for the
offence under Sections 498A, 304B and 201, IPC in the Court of Magistrate, from where the
case was committed to the Court of Session. Arvind Kumar And Ors. vs The State Of Rajasthan
on 26 April, 2001. Judge convicted the accused appellants for the offence under Sections 498A
and 304B, IPC and sentenced each of them in the manner as indicated above holding inter-alia.
In defence, four witnesses were produced by the accused apellants.
The learned Sessions Judge erred in coming to the conclusion that it was a case of dowry death.
Accused appellants No. 3 Kantilal, No. 4 Bhanwar Lal, Chetan Lal and No. 6 Popat Lai
wrongly held to be proved without evidence. In Shanti v. State of Harvana, His Lordship K.
Jayachandra Reddy (as he then was) said: 'A careful analysis of Section 304B, IPC shows that
this section has the following essentials:- That death of a woman should be caused by burns or
bodily injury or otherwise than under normal circumstances'.
Motive for a murder may or may not be individual, but in dowry deaths, it is inherent. 16.
PW15 Dr. Hastimal states in his examination that on 7-8-1992, he conducted the post mortem
of the dead body of the deceased and for that, Medical Board was constituted in which apart
from him, Dr. Gajendra Singh and Dr. Saloni Agrawal were also members and he found that
deceased was having 90% burns and cause of her death was shock due to extensive burns.
There is no dispute on the point that death of the deceased took place within seven years of her
marriage. From the statement of Dr. Hastimal and post mortem report Ex. P/16, it appears that
deceased died because of burns. For the offence under Section 304B, IPC, it is immaterial
whether a person's death is suicidal or homicidal.
Dr. Vasudeo, who was produced by the prosecution to prove the medical examination report
of deceased Ex. P/ 11, has nowhere stated in his examination-in-chief about the so-called dying
declaration Ex. D/4, alleged to have been recorded by DW2 Arvind Kumar Sengwa, DW2 at
place E to F. The other features of this statement Ex.D/4 are , that it bears thumb impressions
of deceased. Tehsildar, Raniwada Arvind Kulashekar Singha and Kantilal Soni, accused
appellant No. 3 at places I to J; that it also bears signatures of Dr Vasudee at places A to B;
and that the mother of the deceased refused to put signatures or thumb impressions on it.
He has further stated that when statement Ex. D/4 was being recorded by him, PW6 Gavri,
mother of the deceased was also there, but she refused to sign it and at the time of recording
statement of the deceased Dr. Vasudeo was also there that Tehsildar recorded her statement in
his presence.
PW12 Shaitan Singh, SHO was given the Tehreer of the deceased Ex. D/4 in writing by the
police and a carbon copy of it was produced by him during the course of his examination. He
did not oust her mother PW 6 Gavri and Dr. Vasudeo from the witness stand.
That it is also correct to say that at the time of recording statement Ex. D/4 of the deceased, he
did not oust her mother PW 6 Gavri and PW11 Dr. Vasudeo. Judge Ranjit Singh: On the above
evidence, the learned Sessions Judge came to the conclusion that so-called dying declaration
Ex, D/4 cannot be believed. In my opinion, the findings of the Learned Sessions Judge in this
respect appear to be appreciable and liable to be confirmed, as they are based on correct
appreciation of evidence on record.
An audio recording of the deceased made by DW2 Arvind Kumar Sengwa has not been presented in this case. Dr. Vasudeo claims that the Tehsildar DW2 did not record the dying declaration Ex.D/4; rather, the reader of the DW2 did.
PW11 Dr. Vasudeo was present when DW2 Arvind Kumar recorded the dead Ex. D/4's testimony, and the fact that it didn't contain any facts further proves that she wasn't in a fit frame of mind to make the statement; otherwise, there should have been support for her.
Ex. D/4, the dying declaration, has the same fundamental flaw and is not admissible as evidence. In this instance, PW5 Parasmal filed report Ex. P/7 on the crucial day, which was on
The fact that deceased was being harassed and tortured for demand of dowry is established.
No dispute on the point that when this amount was demanded by PWS Parasmal from the
accused appellants. This aspect was dealt with by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kans Raj v
State of Punjab.
The presumption under Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act can be raised only if the
accused is being tried for the offence under Section 304B, IPC. Prosecution has been able to
prove its case against the accused appellants No. 1 Arivnd Kumar and No. 3 Kantilal.

In para 40 of the impugned judgment, the learned Sessions Judge, Jalore directed the higher
officers of PW11 Dr. Vasudeo, PW12 Shaitan Singh and DW2 Arvind Kumar Sengwa to be
enquired into. The appeal filed by the accused appellants No. 1 Arvind Kumar (Husband of
the deceased) and No. 3 Kantilal (Jeth of deceased) is dismissed, after confirming the
judgment and order dated 24.2.1997 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Jalore so far as
they relate to them.

case was committed to the Court of Session. Arvind Kumar And Ors. vs The State Of Rajasthan
on 26 April, 2001. Judge convicted the accused appellants for the offence under Sections 498A
and 304B, IPC and sentenced each of them in the manner as indicated above holding inter-alia.
In defence, four witnesses were produced by the accused apellants.
The learned Sessions Judge erred in coming to the conclusion that it was a case of dowry death.
Accused appellants No. 3 Kantilal, No. 4 Bhanwar Lal, Chetan Lal and No. 6 Popat Lai
wrongly held to be proved without evidence. In Shanti v. State of Harvana, His Lordship K.
Jayachandra Reddy (as he then was) said: 'A careful analysis of Section 304B, IPC shows that
this section has the following essentials:- That death of a woman should be caused by burns or
bodily injury or otherwise than under normal circumstances'.
Motive for a murder may or may not be individual, but in dowry deaths, it is inherent. 16.
PW15 Dr. Hastimal states in his examination that on 7-8-1992, he conducted the post mortem
of the dead body of the deceased and for that, Medical Board was constituted in which apart
from him, Dr. Gajendra Singh and Dr. Saloni Agrawal were also members and he found that
deceased was having 90% burns and cause of her death was shock due to extensive burns.
There is no dispute on the point that death of the deceased took place within seven years of her
marriage. From the statement of Dr. Hastimal and post mortem report Ex. P/16, it appears that
deceased died because of burns. For the offence under Section 304B, IPC, it is immaterial
whether a person's death is suicidal or homicidal.
Dr. Vasudeo, who was produced by the prosecution to prove the medical examination report
of deceased Ex. P/ 11, has nowhere stated in his examination-in-chief about the so-called dying
declaration Ex. D/4, alleged to have been recorded by DW2 Arvind Kumar Sengwa, DW2 at
place E to F. The other features of this statement Ex.D/4 are , that it bears thumb impressions
of deceased. Tehsildar, Raniwada Arvind Kulashekar Singha and Kantilal Soni, accused

appellant No. 3 at places I to J; that it also bears signatures of Dr Vasudee at places A to B;
and that the mother of the deceased refused to put signatures or thumb impressions on it.
He has further stated that when statement Ex. D/4 was being recorded by him, PW6 Gavri,
mother of the deceased was also there, but she refused to sign it and at the time of recording
statement of the deceased Dr. Vasudeo was also there that Tehsildar recorded her statement in
his presence.
PW12 Shaitan Singh, SHO was given the Tehreer of the deceased Ex. D/4 in writing by the
police and a carbon copy of it was produced by him during the course of his examination. He
did not oust her mother PW 6 Gavri and Dr. Vasudeo from the witness stand.
That it is also correct to say that at the time of recording statement Ex. D/4 of the deceased, he
did not oust her mother PW 6 Gavri and PW11 Dr. Vasudeo. Judge Ranjit Singh: On the above
evidence, the learned Sessions Judge came to the conclusion that so-called dying declaration
Ex, D/4 cannot be believed. In my opinion, the findings of the Learned Sessions Judge in this
respect appear to be appreciable and liable to be confirmed, as they are based on correct
appreciation of evidence on record.
DW2 Arvind Kumar Sengwa recorded a statement of the deceased, which has not been
produced in the present case. According to Dr. Vasudeo, dying declaration Ex.D/4 was
recorded by the reader of the DW2 and not by the Tehsildar DW2.
PW11 Dr. Vasudeo was present when the statement of the deceased Ex. D/4 was recorded by
DW2 Arvind Kumar and non-mentioning of fact in it, also goes to show that she was not in a
fit state of mind to give statement, otherwise there should have been endorsement of her.

Dying declaration Ex. D/4 also suffers from the same basic infirmity and it is also
inadmissible in evidence. In this case, report Ex. P/7 was lodged by PW5 Parasmal on the
fateful day i.e. on 7-8-1992.
There is convincing evidence that Rs. 50,000 was given by PW5 Parasmal to accused
appellants No. 1 Arvind Kumar (husband of deceased) and No. 3 Kantilal (Jeth of the
deceased) at the time when her daughter (deceased) was to deliver a child.
PW3 Taga states that two months prior to fateful incident, he saw accused appellants No. 4
Bhanwarlal (Jeth of deceased) and one Shaitan knocking on the door of PW5 Parasmal's
house over money transaction.

The fact that deceased was being harassed and tortured for demand of dowry is established.
No dispute on the point that when this amount was demanded by PWS Parasmal from the
accused appellants. This aspect was dealt with by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kans Raj v
State of Punjab.
The presumption under Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act can be raised only if the
accused is being tried for the offence under Section 304B, IPC. Prosecution has been able to
prove its case against the accused appellants No. 1 Arivnd Kumar and No. 3 Kantilal.

In para 40 of the impugned judgment, the learned Sessions Judge, Jalore directed the higher
officers of PW11 Dr. Vasudeo, PW12 Shaitan Singh and DW2 Arvind Kumar Sengwa to be
enquired into. The appeal filed by the accused appellants No. 1 Arvind Kumar (Husband of
the deceased) and No. 3 Kantilal (Jeth of deceased) is dismissed, after confirming the
judgment and order dated 24.2.1997 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Jalore so far as
they relate to them.

Judgment A.V. Savant, J.

Shri Deshpande for the petitioner-original accused, Shri Thakur, Asstt. Public Prosecutor for the State of Maharashtra and Shri R.M. Agrawal for the Union of India and the learned Attorney-General.
This is a Revision against the Judgment and Order of conviction and sentence passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Pune, in Criminal Appeal No. 15 of 1986, decided on 21 st June 1987 under which, he confirmed the Judgment and Order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Court No. 3, Pune, on 13th February 1986 in Regular Criminal Case No. 319 of 1984. Under the impugned Judgments, the petitioner has been convicted for the offence punishable under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code and he has been sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a period of 18 months and to pay a fine of Rs. 1500/-, in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six weeks. This Revision was admitted on 23rd June 1987. By an order dated 30th April 1993, leave was granted to amend the petition and raise a contention regarding the constitutional validity of Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code. This Court directed the issuance of notice to the Attorney-General since the constitutional validity of Section 498-A, IPC was challenged. Shri Agrawal has appeared for the Union of India and the Attorney-General.
 The petitioner Balkrishna married Yogini on 29th December 1982. Yogini, the deceased, was educated upto matriculation and, since 1976, was serving at Hind Condenser Company, at Papyri, near Pune. The petitioner was serving in the College of Military Engineering, at Dapoli, near Pune, as an Assistant in the Library. Soon after the marriage on 29th December 1982, Yogini started complaining to her parents and brother about the quarrels the petitioner used to pick-up with her on petty matters and beat her. There used to be quarrels between the petitioner and Yogini as to the particular finger to be used for applying 'Kumkum' (vermilion) on her forehead. The petitioner wanted Yogini to use a particular finger only, when she was pregnant, dispute arose between the husband and wife as to who should bear the maternity expenses. When she informed the petitioner that her parents were not in a position to bear the maternity expenses, the petitioner got enraged and had beaten her. The petitioner made it clear that he needed that money for some other purpose. Be that as it may, Yogini was sent to her mother's place for delivery and on 16th January 1984 she delivered a girl-Prachi. Even in respect of applying 'Kajal' (black-spot) on Prachi's cheek, there used to be quarrels between the petitioner and Yogini as to the finger to be used.
 On the 28th March 1984, the petitioner's father expired. Yogini came back to the matrimonial home. When the petitioner insisted on her selling her gold ring, her mother P.W. 1 Gangabai, who is the complainant, advised her to go back to the matrimonial home and consult her husband.
On the 17th May 1984, while Yogini was feeding her child, the milk bottle fell and broke. The petitioner lost his temper at this and kicked Yogini. When she protested at her being kicked, the petitioner beat her.  She wrote a letter to her father, which is at Exhibit-14. In the letter, she narrated the incident which had occurred in the morning. She regretted that she was being harassed in the matrimonial home, both by her husband and her mother-in-law. She, therefore, made it clear that she wanted to end her life by burning herself. It is after this letter Exh. 14, which was written in the morning on 17th May 1984, soon after the incident of the milk-bottle breaking at about 8-00 A.M. that Yogini is alleged to have put kerosene on her person and burnt herself at about 11-00 A.M. She was admitted to the Sassoon General Hospital where two dying declarations were recorded; the first dying declaration is Exhibit-22 which is in the form of the case diary recorded by the doctor at the time of admission of the patient to the hospital, at about 12 noon and the other is at Exhibit-24 recorded by the Executive Magistrate at about 3-15 p.m.
The charge under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code was framed against the petitioner. The defence of the petitioner was one of denial. He denied causing any harassment to his wife and, therefore, contended that he was not guilty of the offence punishable under Section 498-A, I.P.C.
He petitioner had, therefore, subjected his wife to cruelty within the meaning of Section 498-A, I.P.C.  which had resulted in his wife putting herself on fire. In the result, the learned Magistrate held the petitioner guilty of the offence punishable under Section 498-A, I.P.C.  and sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 18 months and to pay a fine of Rs. 1500, in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six weeks.  Being aggrieved by the said order of conviction and sentence, the petitioner had preferred Criminal Appeal No. 15 of 1986. The learned Additional Sessions Judge framed the necessary points for consideration, the principal point being whether the petitioner had subjected his wife Yogini to cruelty within the meaning of Section 498-A, I.P.C. It was held that cruelty which the petitioner had subjected his wife to, fell within Clause (a) of the Explanation to Section 498-A, I.P.C. In the result, the conviction and sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate was upheld and the appeal was dismissed on 21st June 1987. These concurrent findings are challenged in this Criminal Revision that was admitted on 23rd June 1987 and the petitioner is on bail since then.
Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.
It is relevant to note that it was by the Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Act No. 46 of 1983, which received the President's assent on 25th December 1983, that Section 498-A was inserted in the Penal Code.
 The extent of the evil was commented upon by the Joint Committee of both the Houses to examine the working of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. It was found that cases of cruelty by the husband and relatives of the husband which culminate in suicide by, or murder of, the hapless woman concerned, constitute only a small fraction of cases involving such cruelty. An offence in the nature of abetment to commit suicide may also attract the provisions of Section 306, l.P.C. which was already on the statute book. It was, therefore, proposed' o suitably amend the Indian Penal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 to effectively deal with not only the cases of dowry deaths, but also the cases of cruelty to married women by their in-laws. It was with a view to achieving this object that, inter alia, Section 498-A was inserted in the Penal Code. The other amendments effected by Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1983 were to Sections 174 and 176 of the said Criminal Procedure Code and the insertion of Section 198-A in the Cr. P. C. The necessary amendment in the First Schedule to the Code of Criminal Procedure, inserting Section 498-A, was also made. As far as the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 is concerned, after Section 113, Section 113-A was inserted raising a presumption against the husband that he or his relative had abetted the suicide by the married woman.
 The first contention is that the husband or relative of the husband cannot be treated as a class apart from the general class of offenders and such a discriminatory treatment given to the husband or his relative violates the guarantee of equal protection of laws enshrined under Article 14 .The second contention is that the definition of the word ""cruelty"" in the two clauses of explanation to Section 498-A of l.P.C. is vague and/or obscure and, therefore, the said section is hit by the provisions of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
Every classification is, in some degree, likely to produce some inequality and mere inequality is not enough to attract the challenge of Article 14 of the Constitution. Differential treatment does not, by itself, constitute violation of Article 14. It can be said to deny equal protection only when there is no reasonable basis for the differential treatment. These principles have been laid down by the Apex Court in (i) Charanjit Lal Chowdhuri v. The Union of India and (ii) the State of Bombay v. F. N. Balsara 1951 SCR 682 : (1951 (52) Cri LJ 1361..
In Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Justice S. R. Tendolkar , the Constitution Bench was called upon to consider the validity of some of the provisions of Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 and it was alleged that the notification issued under Section 3 was ultra vires the provisions of Article 14 of the Constitution.
The principle enunciated above has been consistently adopted and applied in subsequent cases. The decisions of this Court further establish-
 that a law may be constitutional even though it relates to a single individual if, on account of some special circumstances or reasons applicable to him and not applicable to others, that single individual may be treated as a class by himself;  that there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of the constitutional principles;  that it must be presumed that the Legislature understands and correctly appreciates the need of its own people, that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based on adequate grounds;
For considering the question of sentence, by consent, the matter is adjourned to Friday the 3rd April, 1998 at 11.00 a.m. Heard Counsel for the parties on the question of sentence. The petitioner has filed an affidavit dated 30th March, 1998 before us in which he has stated that an amount of Rupees 25,000/- has been deposited by him on 21st March, 1998 in fixed deposit in the name of his daughter Miss Prachi Balkrishna Moghe with Bank of India, Navi Peth Branch, Pune-30. the said deposit is due to mature on 21 st March, 2003 and the maturity value is Rs. 45,153/- as mentioned in receipt No. 3735399 with L. F. No. 22/231 Account No. 3214. The original receipt has been produced for our perusal. The Xerox copy of the said receipt has been filed along with the affidavit dated 30th March, 1998 which is taken on record today and marked ""X"" for identification. The incident in question is of 17th May 1984. The petitioner is looking after his only child namely Prachi. He has not remarried. Prachi was borne on 16th January, 1984. She will attain majority on 16th January, 2002. He is the only person who is presently looking after the welfare of his daughter.

Abstract:
Khimiben Arjanbhai has moved a court praying for quashing and setting aside the impugned
judgment and order dated 9-7-1991. Rasilaben allegedly came to be roasted alive by her husband
Ukabhai alias Haribhai.
Khimiben's daughter Rasila was burnt alive by her husband Ukabhai. Incident took place at the
residence of her in-laws at village Shinay, Taluka -- Anjar. The deceased Rasila for the first time
revealed her sufferings to the petitioner narrating how she was subjected to mental torture.
Petitioner filed a regular complaint before the Dy. Superintendent of Police, Eastern Division,
Anjar, against the respondent for the alleged offences. Under Sections 302 and 302A. Rasila was
doused in Kerosene and set ablaze by applying a lighted match-stick.
The mother of the deceased has moved this court for cancellation of the same by filing the
present Misc. Criminal Application No. 283/ 91 before the learned Sessions Judge Kuta at Bhuj
and obtained anticipatory bail on 9-7-1991. The aggrieved petitioner, who happens to be Mrs
Kuta, is the deceased's mother.
Mr. A.D. Shah, the learned advocate appearing for the petitioner has raised the following
contentions. They are that the discretion exercised by the learned Judge while releasing the
respondent on anticipatory bail is on face of it perverse and therefore deserves to be quashed and
set aside.
This is a serious case of a bride burning on account of dowry demand not satisfied by the
deceased-wife. The police surprisingly for whatever reasons did not arrest the respondent. Not
only that but the police appears to have given more than sufficient time to the respondent to
move the learned Sessions Judge for anticipatory bail.
The judge's reasons for granting anticipatory bail to Primafacie are patently improper and unjust.
He did not consider the circumstances emerging from the investigation papers that cast serious

doubts about the correctness of the dying declaration of the deceased before the Executive
Magistrate. Civil Engineer Rasila's dying declarations are inconsistent and contradictory to the
facts and situation recorded in the Panchnama of the scene of offence. The accused is a Civil
Engineer and has good reputation in the society and if he is arrested, he is likely to be harassed
and harm his reputation.
The learned A.P. Champaneri has vehemently urged for the cancellation of the anticipatory bail
granted to the respondent. Mr. J.G. Shah, the learned advocate appearing for the respondent has
submitted that there can not be any straight jacket formula that whenever any allegation of bride
burning on the ground of Dowry death is made against any husband. Mr A.D. Shah has raised
some disturbing issues in the case of Rasilaben's burning death at the hands of her husband. The
investigating agency's attitude in not immediately apprehending the respondent-accused is quite
inconceivable and indiscreet, writes Mr Shah.
An offence of murder should be registered when there is slightest suspicion to that effect. All
cases of suspicious death should as far as possible, be personally investigated by the Police Sub

Inspectors. Investigation made by Head Constables should be always verified by the Sub-
Inspector. Mr. A.D. Shah made a serious grievance against this type of irresponsible

investigation. The State Government may consider directing an appropriate inquiry into the
matter. Dowry Prohibition Act akin to Section 4 of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.
In the case of Samudarsingh (1987 Cri LJ 705) (Supra), which reads as under. J.G. Shah
submitted that the Supreme Court can not be said to have laid down any absolute proposition of
law or a strait-jacket formula in no case of bride burning and dowry deaths. Gautam E. Ruparel,
an Electrical Engineer with Gujarat Electricity Board and on deputation as Assistant Engineer,
Narmada Project, was in love with Hina, working at M.S. University, Baroda. On 11-2-1991,
Hina received severe burns at her residence and was removed to hospital. The accused Gautam
Ruparel was granted anticipatory bail because the accusation levelled against him by Hariprasad
did not stem from motives of furthering the ends of justice, but rather it stemmed from ulterior
motive of taking back some belongings and money of the deceased Hina.
Mr. J.G. Shah, the learned advocate for the respondent, very vehemently opposed this
application. Mr. A.D. Shah and Mr. P.P. Chapaneri, the counsel for the applicant, have expressed
no objection if the application is granted.
The respondent is directed to surrender to the investigating officer immediately. The impugned
judgment and order passed by the trial court granting anticipatory bail is hereby quashed and set
aside. The respondent will surrender to Adipur Police Station on or before 27-8-1991. Rule made
absolute.
An article by Shri Gautam Mehta in ""Illustrated Weekly of India"" dated 3rd August, 1991, has
vividly depicted the burning problem of atrocities on women in India. The accused are not

immediately apprehended or lightly released on anticipatory bail. With a woman dying of burns
every hour, Gujarat is ahead of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh in the dowry death stakes.
This abhorrent social evil is allegedly encouraged with connivance of corrupt officials and
doctors. The State's recent efforts to control it have not worked.
At least 24 women die of burns in the State daily -- giving it the dubious distinction of being the
lad where the greatest number of women are burnt to death by someone or set themselves alight.
From January 1989 to June 30, 1991, nearly 18,000 members of the second sex have lost their
lives by fire. At least 4,500 women die of burns every year in the State. Of 10,000 deaths on
record, only 95 have been recorded as dowry deaths. Rampant corruption among police,
judiciary, executive magistrates and doctors is a major cause of such cases.
Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 empowers the Central and State governments with discretionary
power to make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act. It appears to this court that West
Bengal State Government may also take some measures by framing rules on the line of Section
21(1)(i)(iv)(v) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act,
1989.
Section 21. Provision for providing adequate facilities, including legal aid, to the persons
subjected to atrocities to enable them to avail themselves of justice. (iv) The appointment of
officers for initiating or exercising supervision over prosecutions for the contravention of the
provisions of this Act. (v) Setting up of committees at such appropriate levels as the State
Government may think fit to assist in formulation or implementation of such measures.
Despite announcements by the State Govt. that it is taking special care in cases of atrocities on
women, dowry death etc. what we are noticing is that simple step like moving the High Court for
cancellation of bail is either not taken at all, or if taken, then the same is not taken as
expeditiously as one ordinarily expects. Bail in cases of bride burning and dowry deaths comes
before the Court for admission after two to four months. In serious criminal cases, such as
murder, rape, gang-rape, dacoity, smuggling etc. the hearing is so much delayed that the
underlying object of bail practically loses all its purpose. Most of the time is unnecessarily
consumed because of the intermediary bottle-necks which could be easily taken care of and time
shortened. It is hoped that the Government may devise some measures as a result of which such
defaults, as far as possible, are not repeated.
The Registrar is directed to forward a copy of this judgment to (i) The Secretary, Legal
Department (Legislation) Gandhinagar; (ii) The Secretary, Home Department, Gandhinagar; and
(iii) The Director General of Police, Ahmedabad/Gandhinagar.

Abstract
This is complainant's application under Section 439(2) Cr. P.C. for cancellation of anticipatory
bail granted to the non-applicants by Shri K. A. Sisodiya, Second Additional Sessions Judge,
Raisen on 7-8-89 and 8-8-1989 in bail application Nos. 546/89 and 636/89 respectively.
It appears that Vinita, Daughter of the applicant was married to non-applicant Hargovind on 7-5-
1987. She died on 7-7-1989 apparently because of poisoning. Facts in the case diary reveal that
she had become pregnant and aborted a child at Jabalpur in June 1989 and also reveal that on 8-
7-1989 at 1.45 A. M. intimation was received through Mahesh, ward boy of Government
Hospital Udaypura, district Raisen that Vinita was brought to the hospital by non-applicant
Hargovind and his father Kanhaiyalal for treatment but on examination she was found already
dead. The intimation was given by Dr. S. N. Singh on 7-7-1989 at 10.10 p.m. On receipt of this
intimation 'Marg' was recorded and two constables sent to hospital for inquiry. Hargovind
revealed that Vinita had started feeling headache at about 4 p.m. On 7-7-1989 and had
slept.There after between 5 and 5.30 p.m. she started vomiting and passing loose motions.
Hargovind informed the police authorities and his father-in-law Chain Singh that he had taken
Vinita to Deori on his tractor for treatment and that she had fainted on reaching Deori . By then
Vinita's condition had deteriorated and therefore it was decided to take her to Bhopal. While
proceeding to Bhopal, it was decided to get her treated at Udaipura hospital where Vinita was
examined by the Doctor only to find that she was dead. The case diary reveals that on 8-7-89 at
about 7 a.m. Panchanama of the dead body was prepared when it was suspected that Vinita had
died of poisoning. It was therefore decided to get the post-mortem done, and the body was sent
for the purpose immediately thereafter. Statements of Harisingh, Dhiraj Singh and Kanhaiyalal
were also recorded. Chain Singh, the father of the deceased could not give his statement as he
was mentally disturbed. The inquiry continued on 9-7-89. Applicant Chain Singh alleged that
Hargovind Kanhaiya Lal and Smt. Kalabai had been treating Vinita with cruelty to obtain Rs.
50,000/- as dowry and that was the cause of her death. The death had caused lot of problems in
the area it was suspected that Vinita bai had been killed by administering poison. President and
Members of Kirar Samaj sent an application to the S. D. O. (Police) Bareli for proper action.
The entire kirar community was agitated creating serious law and order problem. The case diary
reveals that the investigation continued and eventually offences under Sections 304-B/306 IPC
registered. At this stage Hargovind Kanhaiya Lal made an application for grant of anticipatory
bail the the offence appears to be Under Section 306 IPC and stated offence Under Section 304-

B. I.P.C. The learned Judge was of the opinion, that no seizure was to be effected from the non-
applicant and therefore granted anticipatory bail.

The order dated 7-8-89 indicates that the non-applicants were represented by Shri Vijay Dhakad,
Advocate and the State was represented by Shri J. P. Shukla, Advocate. On 8-8-1989, however,
the State was represented by Shri P. R. Dhakad, father of Shri Vijay Dhakad, Advocate
appearing for non-applicants on 7-8-1989. The order dated 3-8-1989 records that Shri P. R.
Dhakad did not submit anything special to contradict the allegations made by Hargovind
Kanhaiyalal. Both the orders do not take into consideration, the allegation relating to offence
punishable Under Section 304-B I.P.C. nor do they indicate that the respondent state had
submitted that there was likelihood of investigation being influenced.
The submission of the applicants, in this Court is that the order granting anticipatory bail is not
filed and has been obtained from the learned Judge by influencing him. It is also submitted that
Shri Dhakad the prosecutor had been instrumental in this process as his son Vijay Dhakad had
been engaged on behalf of the non-applicants. It is also submitted that the learned Judge had
intentionally not noticed allegations relating to offence Under Section 304-B IPC and the
decision in Supreme Court that bail should not be granted in cases of dowry death.
Section 438 Cr. P.C. confers discretion on the Sessions Judge to grant anticipatory bail to a
person who has reason to believe that he may be arrested for a non cognizable offence. In
Gurbaksh Singh v. State of Punjab AIR 1980 SC 1632: (1980 Cri LJ 1125) the Supreme Court
considered the ambit and scope of this power and held that it did not suffer from any limitation
much less from the limitations mentioned in Section 437 Cr. P.C. In spite of it, The question
whether bail should be granted or not depends upon variety of circumstances, the Supreme Court
made the following observations in this regard:
In regard to anticipatory bail, if the proposed accusation appears to stem not from motives of
furthering the ends of justice but from some ulterior motive, the object being to injure and
humiliate the applicant by having him arrested, a direction for the release of the applicant on bail
in the event of his arrest would generally be made. On the other hand, if it appears likely,
considering the antecedents of the applicant, that taking advantage of the order of anticipatory
bail he will flee from justice, such an order would not be made. But the converse of these
propositions is not necessarily true. The nature and seriousness of the proposed charges, the
context of the events likely to lead to the making of the charges, a reasonable possibility of the
applicant's presence not being secured at the trial, a reasonable apprehension that witnesses will
be tampered with and ""the larger interests of the public or the State"" are some of the
considerations which the court has to keep in mind, while deciding an application for
anticipatory bail. The relevance of these considerations was pointed out in State v. Captain Jagit
Singh, (1962) 3 SCR 622 : AIR 1962 SC 253 : (1962) (1) Cri LJ 215) which, though, was a case
under the old Section 498 which corresponds to the present Section 439 of the Code. A person
seeking anticipatory bail is still a free man entitled to the presumption of innocence. No other
decision of the Supreme Court has been brought to the notice of this Court which has the effect
of reducing the force of aforesaid decision or laying down any different law. In spite of it, the
Supreme Court in Samunder Singh v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1987 SC 737 : (1987 Cri LJ 705)
expressed its displeasure on the High Court granting anticipatory bail in dowry death cases.
ignoring the available fact; that entire Kirar Samaj was agitated on this incident and situation had
become such that the S. D. O. (Police) Bareli Shri M. K. Mugdal and S.P., Raisen had said to be

alert that anything can happen. It also ignores the statement of Chain Singh as also discrepancies
discovered by the police which according to them, reasonably point to the involvement of the
non-applicants, and (iii) the fact that Shri Dhakad, Advocate, who admittedly is the son of the
Govt. Pleader was engaged by the non-applicants. As regards Section 304-B IPC, the provision
was inserted by Dowry Prohibition (Amendment Act, 1986) and provides for punishment with
imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than 7 years but which may, extend to
imprisonment for life. This Act has also introduced Section 113-B in the Evidence Act. The case
diary mentions that the offence has been registered Under Section 304-B IPC. The facts give rise
to a reasonable inference that the learned Additional Sessions Judge has not honestly exercised
the 'judicial discretion'. Then engagement of Shri Vijay Dhakad, Advocate, by the non-applicants
when his father was working as Govt. pleader speaks volume about involvement of the Govt.
Pleader in the matter. It also explains why Shri Dhakad, Govt. Pleader did not submit anything to
contradict allegations of the non-applicants on 8-8-1989. It is true that Shri Dhakad withdrew
from the case on 7-8-89 to appear again on 8-8-1989 but that does not provide any justification
to his conduct. He had apparently done so to facilitate his son's success in obtaining bail.
In spite of it, this court treats the case of Smt. Raja Bai and Smt. Kala Bai differently than others
mainly because they are ladies and Smt. Raja Bai is shown to be more than 50 years of age.
Cancelling the bail of Non-applicants 1, 2 and 3 would, in the opinion of this Court, create the

desired impact and act as deterrent on others. In this view of the matter, bail granted to non-
applicants Hargovind, son of Kanhaiyalal, Kanhaiyalal S/o Ram Prasad and Ramgopal son of

Kanhaiyalal is hereby cancelled. They shall be arrested and committed to custody. The Judicial
Magistrate before whom the challan has been filed will take necessary action, in accordance with
law to comply with this order.
The state should take lesson from this case and start appointing a person of honesty and integrity
in important positions like Govt. Pleaders.

The four applications filed under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure relate to Crime No. 705/2001, Police Station, Civil Lines, Raipur, they were heard analogously and are being disposed of by this common order.
The applicant in M.Cr.C. No. 662/2002 Manish Agrawal is the husband, the applicant in M.Cr.C. No. 148/2002 Laxmi Narayan Agrawal is the father-in-law, the applicant in M.Cr.C. No. 189/2002 Smt. Vimla Devi Agrawal is the mother-in-law and the applicant in M.Cr.C. No. 146/2002 Manoj Agrawal is the ""Devar"" of deceased Puja.
Arrest in connection with Crime No. 705/2001, registered by Police Station, Civil Lines, Raipur for an offence punishable under Section 304B of the IPC, the applicant Manoj Agrawal (in M.Cr.C. No. 146/2002) along with his sister Dr. Sarita Agrawal had moved an application (Bail Petition No. 3146/2001) under Section 438 of Cr. PC before the Lower Court which, on 2-1-2002, has allowed the application with respect to Dr. Sarita Agrawal.
 The applications of applicant-Laxmi Narayan Agrawal in M.Cr.C. No. 148/2002 (Bail Petition No. 3147/2001), that of applicant-Manish Agrawal in M.Cr.No. 146/2002 (Bail Petition No. 3149/2001) and that of applicant-Smt. Vimla Devi Agrawal in M.Cr.C. No. 189/2002 (Bail Petition No. 3148/2001) were rejected by the 7th Additional Sessions Judge, Raipur on 2-1-2002. Accordingly.
The complainant, i.e., father (Shyam Sunder Agrawal) of the deceased/Puja has also filed an objection. According to the objector, fact a case of murder but because of the influence of the accused persons, the investigating agency is trying to convert the case of murder into a case of suicide or dowry death.
The marriage of applicant-Manish Agrawal and deceased/Puja was performed on 24-5-2001. Both husband and wife stayed in the matrimonial home for a few days and thereafter they left for their honeymoon trip to the South on 5-6-2001, from where they returned to Raipur on 17-6-2001. After staying at Raipur for about 3 to 4 days they left for Bhilai and stayed there from 22-6-2001 to 23-6-2001 and on the same day returned to Raipur. On 26-6-2001 Puja died on account of burn injuries.
 It is their submission that in a case where an offence under Section 304B of IPC has been registered, anticipatory bail under Section 438, Cr.PC cannot be granted. the objection is that it cannot be granted and for this reason reference to the provisions contained in Sections 437, 438 and 439, Cr.PC becomes necessary since the said three provisions relate to grant of bail.Section 437, Cr.PC, relates to cases where bail can be taken in the case of non-bailable offence. Needless to say, Section 438, Cr.PC relates to anticipatory bail in non-bailable offence and Section 439, Cr.PC deals with special powers of High Court or the Court of Session regarding bail. 
 if there appear some reasonable grounds for believing that he has been guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life. Such a provision is significantly absent and has not been incorporated by the lawmakers in Section 438 or Section 439, Cr.PC. The legislature would definitely have incorporated the same in Section 438 or 439, Cr.PC 
 The case of provisions contained in Section 437, Cr.PC. The provisions contained in Section 438 or 439, Cr.PC shall not apply with respect to an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life. the Court has no power to grant anticipatory bail in cases punishable with death or imprisonment for life, in the case at hand an offence under Section 304B, cannot be accepted.
Sub-section (1) of Section 438, Cr.PC provides that when any person has reason to believe that he may be arrested on an accusation of having committed a non-bailable offence, he may apply to the High Court or the Court of Session, under Section 438, Cr.PC is whether the person who has approached the Court has reasons to believe that he may be arrested on an accusation of having committed a ""non-bailable offence"". Once these two conditions are satisfied, an application under Section 438, Cr.PC is maintainable.
 Section 438, Cr.PC would reveal that the section itself provides a guideline for exercise of powers under this section. The words ""if it thinks fit"", occurring in this Section, in the opinion of the Court,  ""it is a fit case"" for exercise of powers under Section 438, Cr.PC. Thus, the contention that anticipatory bail cannot be granted to an accused in connection with an offence punishable under Section 304B, IPC, cannot be accepted .
Samunder Singh v. State of Rajasthan and Ors., (AIR 1987 SC 737) wherein while considering the question of grant of anticipatory bail in a dowry death case, the Apex Court observed that it is a not compulsory for the High Court to grant anticipatory bail in such matters. the Apex Court in Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia v. The State of Punjab (AIR 1980 SC 1632) wherein the Constitutional Bench while discussing the scope of Sections 437 and 438, Cr.PC observed
 Section 438 confers on the High Court and the Court of Session the power to grant anticipatory bail if the applicant has reason to believe that he may be arrested on an accusation of having committed ""a non-bailable offence"". no warrant for reading into this provision the conditions subject to which bail can be granted under Section 437(1) of the Code. If it was intended that the exception contained in Section 437(1) should govern the grant of relief under Section 438(1),reference was also made to the case of Raghuvir Saran Agarwal v. State of U.P. and Ors. [(1998) 8 SCC 617] which was also a case of dowry death in which the order of High Court granting anticipatory bail was set aside. because it had not, considering the seriousness of the offence, recorded any reasons for exercising the jurisdiction under Section 438, Cr.PC.
With respect to the power to grant anticipatory bail reference may also be made to a decision of the Apex Court in Balchand Jain v. State of Madhya Pradesh (AIR 1977 SC 366) wherein it was held that Section 438 of the Code is an extra- ordinary remedy and should be resorted to only in special cases.
The Court is also required to examine the material available with the Police and to determine if it is ""a fit case"" in which to exercise its power for granting anticipatory bail. reverting to the facts of the case at hand, it is seen that as per the post-mortem report, Puja died as a result of anti-mortem burns.
On 26-6-2001 at about 6.00 p.m. Smt. Vimla Agrawal informed the Civil Lines Police Station, Raipur that Puja, her daughter-in-law had burnt herself. Ramesh Chand Agarwal, father of Puja admits that Manish, his son-in-law had informed him that Puja had sustained burns (jal gayee hai) and thereafter he again received a telephone message from his son-in-law that Puja is dead. On receiving the intimation family members of Puja had rushed to Raipur. The statements of Ramesh Chand Agarwal and Neeladevi, parents of Puja were recorded on 27-6-2001.
The police had also recorded the statements of Matadin Agarwal, elder brother of Puja's father and Shyam Sunder Agarwal, Puja's uncle --brother of Ramesh Chand Agarwal and that of Smt. Ratnidevi w/o Shyam Sunder Agarwal. 
The police had also recorded the statement of Rajkumar, cousin of Puja, who in fact was instrumental in bringing about the matrimonial alliance. The police have also recorded the statement of Vandana, sister of Puja, who has stated that she had met Puja after her marriage, Puja said was ""Mun nahi lakta"" and that she will explain when they meet at Shambalpur. The statement of Raju, husband of Vandana is also on similar lines. The police had also recorded the statement of Dr. Tripti Nagaria to whom Puja had gone for consultation because she was having no seminal discharge. It is stated by Dr. Tripti Nagaria after discussing the problem,  she told her that things will become normal .
The case diary reveals that subsequently, on 29-6-2001, Ramesh Chand Agarwal, father of Puja had sent a complaint to the Officer-in-Charge, Civil Lines, Raipur that his daughter had been murdered and to shield the offence her body was burnt by her husband and his relatives, and hence an offence under Section 304B of IPC was registered on 13-10-2001 wherein Shyam Sunder Agarwal, uncle of Puja is shown as the complainant.
The statements of Manish, Puja's husband, his parents, his sister and other persons have also been recorded during the course of investigation and all of them have denied that they had demanded any dowry, but the Court is not for the purpose of these proceedings, considering their statements as being favourable to the applicants.
It appears that the higher police authorities are also taking note of the investigation. At page Nos. 92,102 and 142 of the case diary it is mentioned that 'no positive evidence about any demand of dowry or ill-treatment for want of it has been made out so far'.
The registration of the offence on 13-10-2001, the police again recorded the statement of Ramesh Chand Agarwal, Puja's father, who has stated that there was a demand of dowry and accordingly. Rs. 4 lakhs in cash and jewellery worth Rs. 2 lakhs was paid.  the statement of Puja's mother Neeladevi, which was also recorded on 17-10-2001. Thus, in their subsequent statements Puja's parents state about demand of dowry and ill-treatment of their daughter by her in-laws, which is completely contradictory to their earlier signed statements which were recorded on 27-6-2001 where it was categorically stated that there was no demand of dowry nor was any complaint made after the marriage by Puja. The statement of Ratnidevi w/o Shyam Sunder Agarwal was also recorded on 17-10-2001 where she has, contradicting her earlier statement contained at page 56 of the case diary, stated that after the engagement ceremony there was demand of dowry which was met and after the marriage, Puja's in-laws, her brother-in-law, sister-in-law and husband were troubling Puja, who had burnt herself because of demand of dowry.
There are two sets of statements on record. In their earlier signed statements Puja's parents, uncle and aunt ,clearly stated that there was no demand of dowry nor had Puja ever complained about any demand or ill-treatment but used to say that all is well.Their statements after about three months of the unfortunate inident, they have stated that there was demand of dowry and that Puja was being ill-treated and harassed by in-laws, her husband and his family members, that she was murdered and, to hide that act her body was burnt.  the learned Counsel for the applicants drew the attention of the Court to that portion of post-mortem report where it is mentioned that black soot particles were present in the wind pipe of the deceased. 
As is clear from the case diary an offence under Section 304B of Indian Penal Code and not under Section 302, IPC, has been registered against the applicants. This aspect therefore need not be considered any further.At the same time, if the circumstances on record are such which give rise to an inference that the accusation are malafide and appear to be false or groundless, it would not be proper to refuse exercise of powers conferred upon the Court under Section 438 of Cr.PC.
considering the fact that immediately after the unfortunate incident all the relatives of the deceased had given signed statements that there was neither any settlement of dowry nor any demand made nor had the deceased ever complained about any ill treatment or torture, the Court is of the opinion that anticipatory bail for a limited period should be granted to the applicants.

Bench: S Khare
Judgement:S.P. Khare, J.
Appellants Kamlesh, Ram Milan and Laxmi Bai have been convicted under Sections 304B,
306 and 498A, IPC, and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for ten years, seven years and two
years respectively.
It is not in dispute that deceased Anita committed suicide by hanging herself on 27-6-1997 in
her matrimonial home in village Shivrajpur within three years of her marriage with accused
Kamlesh.
The prosecution case is that the accused persons were demanding an amount of Rs. 10,000/-
and a T. V. as dowry; she was being harassed by them on that count and an amount of Rs.
2,000/-was paid to them a month prior to her death.Panchamlal father of the deceased submitted
a written report to the Police on 9-9-1997 stating therein that it was a case of dowry death.
The trial Court after appreciation of the evidence on record held that the accused persons
demanded dowry and harassed the deceased before her deathIt is also contended that the FIR
was made as late as two months and ten days and, therefore, such a report does not have any
corroborative value and it is said that this report was made because the accused persons refused
to pay an amount of Rs. 7,000/- to the parents of the deceased which they claimed to have
incurred as expenses in the marriage.
The ingredients of the offence of dowry death punishable under Section 304B, IPC are (a) the
death of a woman must have been caused by burns or bodily injury or otherwise than under
normal circumstances; (b) such death must have occurred within seven years of her marriage;
(c) soon before her death, the woman must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her
husband or by relatives of her husband; (d) such cruelty or harassment must be for or in
connection with demand for dowry and (e) such cruelty or harassment is shown to have been
meted out to the woman soon before her death. (Kans Raj v. State of Punjab AIR 2000 SC 2324
: 2000 Cri LJ 2993.
It is an admitted fact that Panchamlal , Batasiabai who are parents of the deceased and
Naresh who is their son-in-law were present at the time of the inquest on 28-6-1997 in village
Shivrajpur
It is true that the scope of an inquest proceeding under Section 174 Cr.P.C. is limited but in
the present case there was not only the inquest but inquiries were made from the three witnesses
named above and at that time they did not reveal the story of demand of dowry or harassment
by the accused persons.
""information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence"" under Section 154, Cr.P.C.
and would have been reduced into writing.whether there was any cruelty or harassment of the
deceased on the pretext that at that stage they are only making inquiries regarding the Marg
under Section 174, Cr.P.C. and there is long interval before a formal FIR of any of the relatives
is recorded.
The Supreme Court observed in G.B. Patel v. State of Maharashtra AIR 1979 SC 135 : 1979
Cri LJ 51 that inordinate delay in registration of the 'FIR' and further delay in recording the
statements of the material witnesses.

In the present case the statements of the parents and Naresh were recorded on the next day of
the inquest but in those statements they did not make any allegation regarding the demand of
dowry or harassment to the deceased by the accused persons. This is borne out from the written
report which was submitted before the police on 9-9-1997.
It is stated therein that Panchamlal and other witnesses who were with him did not disclose in
their statements regarding the demand of Rs. 10,000/- and T. V. and payment of Rs. 2,000/-
but it is being submitted in writing now.He has not given any plausible explanation in his
evidence why he kept silent for nearly two and half months after the death of his daughter.
As a matter of fact the report E was produced in the Court on 20-4-2000 by Batasia Bai when
her evidence was being recorded.
A copy of this report was given to the counsel for the accused on 20-4-2000 and the statements
of these two witnesses were recorded on 28-10-1999 and 3-12-1999. In the report it is stated
that Anita had come 2-3 times after her marriage from the house of her husband to her parents
and then he had described that there was demand of Rs. 10,000/- and T. V.
It was never the prosecution case in the FIR or in the statements Under Section 161, Cr.P.C.
that any physical cruelty was meted out to her by the accused persons. Naresh has stated that
Anita had told him that the accused persons are saying that insufficient dowry has been given
in the marriage and there is demand of Rs. 10,000/-and a T.V. This witness does not say that
Anita had complained of any harassment or torture by the accused persons.
After the submission of the report dated 9-9-1908 before the S.D.O. (Police) he registered the
case In this report, that in the earlier statements the parents of the deceased did not disclose that
there was any demand of dowry or physical or mental cruelty towards the deceased by the
accused persons.
In the report it is not disclosed that this amount of Rs. 2,000/- was paid one month prior to the
death of Anita.
On the other hand Batasia Bai has stated that this amount of Rs. 2,000/- was borrowed from
Naresh (PW. 8) but, as already stated, Naresh does not say that this amount was given by him
as a loan to his father-in-law.
The statements of Panchamlal . Naresh and Batasia Bai were recorded on 9-9-1997 in stereo
type manner. These are in the handwritings of the person other than the Investigating Officer.
The statements of the three prosecution witnesses, named-above, are on record. The statement
of Batasia Bai (PW. 11) under Section 161 Cr.P.C. has been marked . In recording these
statements it should have been clarified when actually demand of the amount of Rs. 10,000/-
and the T.V. was made and when the amount of Rs. 2000/- was paid.The marriage of Kamlesh
with Anita was the second marriage. It does not appear probable that Ram Milan and Laxmi
Bai would demand the amount of Rs. 10,000/- and T.V. as dowry when they were living
separately.
Ramnath is also son-in-law of Panchamlal . He has deposed that Anita never complained to
him that there was any demand of dowry by the accused persons. He has further stated that a
Panchayat had taken place in June, 2000 in the house of Lalla in village Kuthla in which it was
expressed by the parents of Anita that an amount of Rs. 7,000/- should be paid to them by
accused Kamlesh which was spent by them in the marriage of Anita.
The Supreme Court has observed in Sunil Bajaj v. State of M.P. (2001) 9 SCC 417 : 2001 Cri
LJ 4700 that in a case under Section 304B, IPC there is need for greater care and caution, that
too having regard to the gravity of the punishment prescribed for the said offence.

In the result the appeal is allowed. The conviction and sentence are set aside and the appellants
are acquitted of the charges under Section 304B, 306 and 498A, IPC.

Learned counsel further submitted that Indrapal Singh, uncle of appellant Bharat Sharan Singh, who had given information to police for the first time regarding the death of deceased was also not examined by the prosecution. Learned counsel further submitted that no complaint regarding demand of dowry or harassment was made by the informant earlier to this occurrence. Learned counsel further submitted that the trial Court, without considering the material available on record in proper manner, has passed the impugned judgment and order in a very cursory manner which is liable to be set aside. 
Gurnaib Singh vs. Sher Singh  Partapa vs. Per contra, learned AGA vehemently opposed the submissions of learned counsel for appellants and submitted that death of the deceased has been caused by burn injuries within seven years of her marriage, inside the house of the appellants and the deceased was tortured and harassed soon before her death for demand of dowry. Learned AGA further submitted that the fact that the marriage of the deceased was solemnised in the year 1986 and her death was caused in 1990, due to burn injuries, has been admitted by the appellants in their statement under Section 313 of the Code. after wrapping so many clothes , itself is evident that death of the deceased was caused by the appellants. Learned AGA further submitted that the appellants have also failed to lead any evidence to prove that the deceased was mentally weak or any type of evidence in their defence. , if the essential element of dowry death is proved, the appellants may be convicted for offence under Section 304 B IPC. In Baijnath , where the appellant was exonerated by the trial Court but convicted by the High Court and there was evidence that appellant Baijnath was living separately, appellants were sufficiently well-off as stated by defence witnesses in the facts and circumstances of the case, Honble Apex Court held that only the factum of unnatural death of deceased in matrimonial home within seven years of her marriage is not sufficient for the offence under Sections 304-B, 498-A IPC unless other ingredients of dowry death and cruelty are proved by the prosecution. Appellants have been convicted and sentenced for offence under Sections 304-B and 498-A IPC.

Manoj Jain vs Smt. Krishna Jain & Ors. on 4 October, 2012
Author: Valmiki J. Mehta

By the judgment dated 31.7.2012, it was held that daughters have an equal right in the coparcenary property in terms of the amended Section 6(1) of the Hindu Succession Act, 
1956 by virtue of Act 39 of 2005. after amendment of Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act,w.e.f. 9.9.2005, the daughters have an equal right to that of the son in the HUF property. Section 6(1) of the said Act which specifically provides that now daughters will have an equal share as a male coparcener in the HUF properties.accordingly we have to be decreed on that accepted basis that there was a HUF of which father late Sh. Lakhpat Rai was the karta,2 to 4 (sons) were male coparceners and defendant nos. 5 and 6 (daughters of Sh. Lakhpat Rai) and defendant No.1/mother would be the family members of the HUF and all the parties to the suit have an equal share in the properties of the HUF, including the house C-9, NPSE- II, New Delhi.""

petition is predicated on two grounds.The first ground is that the provision of Section 6(1) brought in by Act 39 of 2005 is prospective in nature, and since in the present case father-Sh.Lakhpat Rai Jain expired on 29.12.1992 i.e before passing of the Act 39 of 2005, therefore, succession having already opened on 29.12.1992, the daughters of Sh.Lakhpat Rai Jain did not have a right in the coparcenary property, and hence Section 6(1) does not give them a legal right in the present suit filed in 2007.
The second ground which is urged is that the daughters have no rights because relinquishment deeds The first aspect required to be squarely pronounced upon thus is that if succession opens on account of death of a coparcener prior to bringing in of Section 6(1) by Act 39 of 2005, would the daughters by virtue of subsequent bringing in of the aforesaid Section 6(1) by Act 39 of 2005, get a right to the coparcenary property, i.e did rights finally
crystallize on the death of coparcener on 29.12.1992 in this case when the provision of Section 6(1) giving right to the daughters did not exist in the statute book.
The daughters get a right to the HUF properties even if the succession opens on account of death of the coparcener prior to coming into force of Section 6(1) by Act 39 of 2005.
the Supreme Court in this regard being Sheela Devi & Ors. vs. Lal Chand & Anr., 2006 (8) SCC 581 and G.Sekar vs. Geetha& Ors., 2009 (6) SCC 1999 to argue that Section 6(1) is only prospective in nature and cannot apply when succession has already opened prior to bringing in of Section 6(1) by Act 39 of 2005.The case of Sheela Devi (supra) is relied upon by the review petitioners right upon the female heirs, even in relation to the joint family property, enacted the Hindu Succession Act, 2005. Such a provision was enacted as far back in 1987 by the State of Andhra Pradesh. The succession having opened in 1989, evidently, the provisions of the Amendment Act, 2005 would have no application.
sub-section (1) of Section 6 of the Act creates an exception. First son of Babu Lal vs. Lal Chand, was, thus, a coparcener.Apart from Lal Chand, Sohan Lal will also derive the benefit thereof. So far as the second son, Sohan Lal is concerned, no evidence has been brought on record to show that he was born prior to coming into force of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956.""The judgment in the case of G.Sekar (supra) is concerned Neither the 1956 Act nor the 2005 Act.The High Court might have committed a mistake in opining that the operation of Section 3 of the 2005 Act is retrospective in character, but, for the reasons aforementioned, it does not make any difference.
Sheela Devi's (supra) case and G.Sekar's (supra) case, the observations do speak of the 2005 Act not re-opening the vested rights where succession had already taken place.
it is apposite to refer to the observations of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of Padma Sundara Rao (Dead) & Ors. vs. State of Tamil Nadu & Ors., 2002 (3) SCC 533. It is to be remembered that judicial utterances are made in the setting of the facts of a particular case, said Lord Morris in Herrington v. British Railways, Board. Circumstantial flexibility, one additional or different fact may make a world of difference between conclusions in two cases.
The aforesaid observations in Padma Sundara Rao's (supra) case clearly hold that judgments of Courts should not be read like a statute, Padma Sundara Rao's (supra) case has been followed in other judgments of the Supreme Court including Krishna Mochi & Ors. vs. State of Bihar, 2002 (6) SCC 81 and Charan Singh & Ors. vs. State of UP, 2004 (4) SCC 205.
the judgments in the cases of Sheela Devi (supra) and G.Sekar (supra) were rendered by the Supreme Court, the direct judgment of the Supreme Court which squarely deals with this proposition as to whether daughters get a right in the coparcenary property by virtue of bringing in of Section 6(1) of the Hindu Succession Act by Act 39 of 2005. This judgment is in the case reported as Ganduri Koteshwaramma & Anr. vs. Chakiri Yanadi & Anr., 2011 (9) SCC 788.

The 1956 Act is an Act to codify the law relating to intestate succession among Hindus. Parliament felt that non-inclusion of daughters in the Mitakshara coparcenary property was causing discrimination them and, accordingly, decided to bring in necessary changes in the law. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 2005 Amendment Act
The retention of the Mitakshara coparcenary property without including the females in it means that the females cannot inherit in ancestral property as their male counterparts do.
but also has led to oppression and negation of her fundamental right of equality guaranteed by the Constitution. the need to render social justice to women, the States of  Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra have made necessary changes in the law giving equal right to daughters in Hindu Mitakshara coparcenary property.""
The new Section 6 provides for parity of rights in the coparcenary property among male and female members of a joint Hindu family on and from 9.9.2005. The legislature has now conferred substantive right in favour of the daughters. According to the new Section 6, the daughter of a coparcener becomes a coparcener by birth in her own rights and liabilities in the same manner as the son.Thus, on and from 9.9.2005, the daughter is entitled to a share in the ancestral property and is a coparcener as if she had been a son.
The right accrued to a daughter in the property of a joint Hindu family governed by the Mitakshara law, by virtue of the 2005 Amendment Act,new Section 6 of the 1956 Act is not applicable are two, namely, (i) where the disposition or alienation including any partition has taken place before 20.12.2004; and (ii) where testamentary disposition of property has been made before 20.12.2004. Sub-section (5) of Section 6 leaves no room for doubt as it provides that this Section shall not apply to the partition which has been effected before 20.12.2004. For the purposes of new Section 6 it is explained that ""partition"" means any partition made by execution of a deed of partition duly registered under the Registration Act, 1908 or partition effected by a decree of a court.
 The partition has been effected before 20.12.2004 by deed of partition duly registered under the Registration Act, 1908 or by a decree of a court. In the backdrop of the above legal position with reference to Section 6 brought in the 1956 Act by the 2005 Amendment Act,
The trial court on 19.3.1999 and amended on 27.9.2003 deprives the appellants of the benefits of the 2005 Amendment Act although final decree for partition has not yet been passed.""
By the judgment dated 31.7.2012, it was held that daughters have an equal right in the coparcenary property in terms of the amended Section 6(1) of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 by virtue of Act 39 of 2005. after amendment of Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 by Act 39 of 2005 w.e.f. 9.9.2005, the daughters have an equal right to that of the son in the HUF property. the daughters also their shares of the properties, and only because of which issue/dispute the suit remains pending.Section 6(1) of the said Act which specifically provides that now daughters will have an equal share as a male coparcener in the HUF properties. the suit accordingly will have to be decreed on that accepted basis that there was a HUF of which father late Sh. Lakhpat Rai was the karta,2 to 4 (sons) were male coparceners and defendant nos. 5 and 6 (daughters of Sh. Lakhpat Rai) and defendant No.1/mother would be the family members of the HUF and all the parties to the suit have an equal share in the properties of the HUF, including the house C-9, NPSE- II, New Delhi.""

Section 6(1) of the Indian Constitution is prospective in nature. The question is whether the law as stated in the cases of Sheela Devi and G.Sekar is correct. Rattiram's case also holds that a judgment, even of a Supreme Court if given in ignorance of a binding legal provision, that judgmentis per incuriam.
The facts in the case of Sheela Devi (supra) show that if succession opens in 1989; i.e prior to Act 39 of 2005; the provision of Section 6(1) will not apply. The issue of femalemembers of a Hindu Undivided Family inheriting the property was directly not in question in the said case.
The judgment in the case of G.Sekar (supra) is concerned, once again, the said judgment does not apply inasmuch as admittedly the Supreme Court in the facts of the said case was not dealing with a Hindu Undivided Family property.
Supreme Court of India Justice Dipak Misra has reserved his decision in the case of Sheela Devi (supra) and G.Sekar, which was referred to the Court of Appeal for review by the Bombay High Court, on appeal at the Peshawar High Court.
Section 6 as amended by Act 39 of 2005 specifically brought in an explanation which was added below sub-Section 5. The legislature by conscious language has made Section 6(1) prospective only under certain facts, situations and retrospective under other facts situations. The categoricalintention so expressed by the legislature has to be abided to.
Petitioner in Para 13 of the plaint only stated that to the best of his knowledge the sisters had relinquished theirrights, and to which aspect the sisters have in fact filed their written statements. Admittedly, norelinquishment deeds (much less registered ones) have been filed by any of the parties including thereview petitioners/defendants no.2 to 4.
The review petition is without any merit and is accordingly dismissed, said the Chief Justice of the Northern Ireland Supreme Court, Justice David Nesbitt. I have heard the review petitioners in detail again andhence the present judgment..
The Local Commissioner is directed to take steps with respect to deciding whether partition by metes and boundaries of the suit properties is possible, and if yes how. If any of the parties have not paid their share of the fee of the Local Commissioner, they shall make the payment within 2 weeks from today. The  further proceedings on 6th December, 2012.

Bench: T.S. Thakur, Adarsh Kumar Goel
Judgement:ADARSH KUMAR GOEL, J.
This appeal has been preferred against the Judgment and Order dated 20th March, 2012 of
the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur in Writ Appeal No.262 of 2010.
Civil Appeal No. of 2014 @ SLP (C) No.36237 of 2012 antecedents of a candidate who is
acquitted for want of evidence or who is discharged from the criminal case on account of
compounding can be justified.
Sultan Khan was serving with the Madhya Pradesh Police.
He died in harness on 21st June, 2005. In one case, he was prosecuted for offences under
Sections 323, 324, 325, 294 and 506-B/34 of the Indian Penal Code and in the other under
Sections 452, 394 and 395 of the Indian Penal Code.
The respondent challenged the said order by way of Writ Petition No.15052 of 2008 on the
ground that in the first case he was acquitted on 31st January, 2007 and in the second he was
discharged on account of compounding of offence.
It was held that the object of verification was to verify suitability of a candidate Civil
Appeal No. of 2014 @ SLP (C) No.36237 of 2012 for employment.
.Discharge on Civil Appeal No. of 2014 @ SLP (C) No.36237 of 2012 account of
compounding of the offence by the victim depended upon the attitude of the parties.
He has also submitted that the State of Madhya Pradesh has issued Guidelines dated 5 th
June, 2003 for character verification of candidates for recruitment to Government service and
such guidelines do no justify rejection of candidature of the respondent. One of the instances
given is of Dilip Kumar Samadhiya son of Shri Jagdish Prasad 2013 (7) SCC 685 Civil
Appeal No. of 2014 @ SLP (C) No.36237 of 2012 Samadhiya against whom three criminal
cases were registered prior to the recruitment in Government service but he was acquitted
either on account of compromise or on account of benefit of doubt.
As per Guidelines dated 5th June, 2003, an independent view can be taken only where
candidate has concealed the information about pendency of trial and not where there is no
such concealment, as in the present case.
Even after order based on Civil Appeal No. of 2014 @ SLP (C) No.36237 of 2012
compromise or lack of evidence may render a candidate ineligible.Action was taken in
regard to the proceedings of compassionate appointment, character verification was got done,
wherein vide Letter No.V.S./21/VHR/2007/17(F)283/07 dated 17.9.2007 of the Police
Headquarters it was informed that a case under Section 294, 323, 506, 324, 34 of IPC had
been registered against the applicant in Police Station Kotwali as Crime No.185/06 and the
applicant was acquitted on the basis of a compromise by the Court on 23.2.2007. In the same
manner in Crime No.494/06 under Section 394, 364, 451 of IPC a case was registered and
vide judgment dated 31.1.2007 of the Court he was acquitted.
Two separate crimes had been registered against the applicant, wherein in one case Section
394, 451, 365 of IPC are there and which come in the category of moral turpitude. In the
judgment of the Court benefit of doubt has been given, therefore, as per the new guidelines of
2003 issued by the Government of Madhya Pradesh in respect of character verification the
applicant Parvez Khan alias Sonu alias Raja has been found to be ineligible for Government
service.post of Constable in Delhi Police, who were Civil Appeal No. of 2014 @ SLP (C)
No.36237 of 2012 provisionally selected subject to verification of their antecedents and who

were subsequently acquitted/discharged in the criminal case, could be cancelled by the
Screening Committee of the Delhi Police on the ground that they are not found suitable for
appointment to the post of Constable.
While Civil Appeal No. of 2014 @ SLP (C) No.36237 of 2012 the standard of proof in a
criminal case is the proof beyond all reasonable doubt, the proof in a departmental
proceeding is preponderance of probabilities.
In R.P.Kapur v. Union of India [AIR 1964 SC 787] this Court has taken a view that
departmental proceedings can proceed even though a person is acquitted when the acquittal is
other than honourable.
The expression honourable acquittal was considered by this Court in S. Samuthiram [2013
(1) SCC 598]. Criminal case was pending against him under Section 509 IPC and under
Section 4 of the Eve-Teasing Act. There was a serious flaw in the conduct of the criminal
case. Two material witnesses turned hostile. Referring to the judgment of this Court in RBI v.
Bhopal Singh Panchal [1994 (1) SCC 541] .
As per the complaint lodged by Ramji Lal, respondent Mehar Singh and others armed with
iron chains, lathis, danda, stones, etc. stopped a bus, rebuked the conductor of the bus as to
how he dared to take the fare from one of their associates.
The FIR was registered under Sections 143, 341, 323 and 427 IPC. The order dated 30-1-
2009 passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Khetri shows that so far as offences
under Sections 323, 341 and 427 IPC are concerned, the accused entered into a compromise
with the complainant. Hence, the learned Magistrate acquitted respondent Mehar Singh and
others of the said offences. The order further indicates that so far as offence of rioting i.e.
offence under Section 147 IPC is concerned, three main witnesses turned hostile.
So far as respondent Shani Kumar is concerned, the FIR lodged against him stated that he
along with other accused abused and threatened the complainants brother. They opened fire at
him due to which he sustained bullet injuries. The offences under Sections 307, 504 and 506
IPC were registered against respondent Shani Kumar and others. The order dated 14-5-2010
passed by the Sessions Judge, Muzaffarnagar shows that the complainant and the injured
person did not support the prosecution case.
In this connection,we may usefully refer to Sushil Kumar [1996(11) CC 605].. Accordingly,
his name was rejected. He approached the Tribunal. The Tribunal allowed the application on
the ground that since the respondent had been discharged and/or acquitted of the offence
punishable under Section 304, Section 324 read with Section 34 and Section 324 IPC, he cannot
be denied the right of appointment to the post under the State.
.From the above observations of this Court, it is clear that a candidate to be recruited to the
police service must be worthy of Civil Appeal No. of 2014 @ SLP (C) No.36237 of 2012
confidence and must be a person of utmost rectitude and must have impeccable character and
integrity.
The plea of parity with two other persons who were recruited can also not help the respondent.
This aspect of the matter was also gone into by this Court in Mehar Singh (supra) and it was
held :
Civil Appeal No. of 2014 @ SLP (C) No.36237 of 2012 36. The Screening Committees
proceedings have been assailed as being arbitrary, unguided and unfettered. But, in the present
cases, we see no evidence of this.
It is well settled that to such cases the doctrine of equality enshrined in Article 14 of the
Constitution of India is not attracted.Having given our thoughtful consideration, we are of the
view that the Division Bench of the High Court was not justified in interfering with the order

rejecting the claim of the respondent Civil Appeal No. of 2014 @ SLP (C) No.36237 of 2012
for recruitment to the police service by way of giving him compassionate appointment.

JUDGMENT:Sikri, J.
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 795 of 1963. Appeal by special
leave from the judgment and decree dated November 24, 1958, of the Madhya Pradesh High
Court at Indore in Civil Special Appeal No. 5 of 1949. C. B. Agarwala, J. D. Patel, J. B.
Dadachanji 0. C. Mathur and Ravinder Narain, for the appellant.
M. P. Amin, C. B. Sanghi V. M. Amin and L N. Shroff, for the respondents.
This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and decree of the Full Bench of
the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in Civil Special Appeal No. 5 of 1949, The Division Bench
accepted the defendants' appeal, reversed the judgment and decree of Sanghi, J., and dismissed
the plaintiff's suit as also his cross appeal. Thereafter the plaintiff filed an appeal under S. 25
of the Madhya Bharat 'High Court of Judicature Act, 1949, as it stood before it was amended
by Madhya Bharat Act No. 3 of 1950.
In view of the arguments urged before us by learned counsel for the appellant, Mr. C. B.
Aggarwala, it is not necessary to give in detail the history of the disputes between the parties,
or all the points that were debated before the High Court.Govindram Seksaria, Brijlal Ramjidas,
Bilasrai Joharmal and four other persons entered into a deed of partnership on July 17, 1935
for carrying on the business of acting as Managing Agents and Selling Agents of Indore Malwa
United Mills Ltd., a company owning a textile mill in Indore. Serious disputes arose between
the partners.
In the meantime, the partners referred their differences to the arbitration of Col. Dina Nath, the
Prime Minister of the former Holkar State. On February 8, 1941, the Arbitrator gave an award,
inter alia deciding that Govindram Seksaria should buy up the five- annas shares of Brijlal
Ramjidas and Bilasrai Joharmal at par and that the latter should sell their respective shares of
annas two and a half each in the rupee at par and also sell the debentures held by them to
Govindram Seksaria at par. On February 12, 1941, Brijlal and Bilasrai instituted a suit in the
Bombay High Court against Govindram and other partners of the Managing Agency contesting
the validity of the award made by Col. Dina Nath.
On November 5, 1947, a deed of assignment of the four-annas share of Brijlal and Bilasrai
was executed in favour of the defendants as legal representatives of Govindram, who had
died in the meantime in May 1946. On November 6, 1947, the plaintiff instituted the suit out
of which this appeal arises.
Both the Division Bench and the Full Bench on appeal have held this issue to be proved and
it is common ground that if the decision of the Full Bench on this issue cannot be
successfully assailed, no further point arises and the appeal must fail.

After the award was made Govindram addressed a letter to Mr. Jall as a member of the Enquiry
Committee on February 13, 1941, intimating to him that the Prime Minister of the Holkar State
had given an award on February 8, 1941, in his favour, and forwarding a copy of the award
The next day the plaintiff accepted the offer and on February 28, 1941, the agreement was
concluded between the parties. A day before the agreement was signed by the parties,
Gulabchand, Plaintiff, addressed a letter to Mr. Jall, the Chairman of the Enquiry Committee,
on February 27, 1941, for holding the meetings of the Committee daily so as to expedite its
report. On February 8, 1941, Govindram met Mr. Jall, and offered to sell to him one anna share,
which he rejected saying that "" as he was the member of the Enquiry Committee, it would look
as if he was making the offer to please him."" The Committee gave its final report on April 7,
1941, which was favourable to Govindram, although the interim report dated December 16,
1940, was none too favourable to him.
Taking into consideration the facts and circumstances narrated in the judgment of the Division
Bench at pages 170 to 173 of the printed paper book, Mr. C. B. Aggarwala, while admitting
that concurrent finding& of fact cannot ordinarily be assailed before this Court, contends that
in this case there is no evidence in support of the findings arrived at by the Full Bench and that
the findings are based on mere surmises.
The real complaint of Mr. Aggarwala in this case seems to be that as bribery was alleged the
Full Bench. ""It is true that I have reasonable doubts whether you did the grossly criminal acts
with which you are charged, but I find that you did so all the same."" And this exclusion of
reasonable doubt is all that the so-called ""criminal proof"" requires.""
He observed that in India, under the Indian Evidence Act, there is no rule that the standard ,of
proof in a case like the present must be the same as if the (1) (1913) I.L.R. 40 Cal. 898 at
916.(2) I.L.R. 39 Cal. 245 :16 C.W.N. 265.defendants were being tried on a criminal
charge.This case (Jarat Kumari Dassi v. Bissesur)(1) was followed in Prasannamayi Debya ,v.
Baikuntha Nath Chattoraj(2).
It is apparent from the above definitions that the Indian Evidence Act applies the same standard
of proof in all civil cases.But this is not to say that the Court will not, while striking the balance
of probability, keep in mind the presumption of honesty or innocence or the nature of the crime
or fraud charged. In our (1) I.L.R. 39 Cal. 245 . 16 C.W.N. 265.(2) I.L.R 49 Cal. 132.
Mr. Aggarwala, relying on Raja Singh v. Chaichoo Singh(1) further urges that in case of
circumstantial evidence.In the end Mr. Aggarwala urges that immorality within s. 23 of the
Indian Contract Act is confined to Sexual immoralitys, but we are not concerned with the
question whether the consideration is immoral or not. The case of bribery is clearly covered
otherwise by s. 23.
In the result we hold that the findings of the Full Bench are, not vitiated and must be accepted.
The appeal, therefore, fails and is dismissed with costs. Appeal dismissed.

criminal appeal. The appellant has challenged the judgment dated 31.7.2002 passed by the Addl.
Sessions Judge (Fast Track), Jhunjhunu whereby the appellant has been convicted for offences
under Section 377 and 302 IPC. For the former offence, the appellant has been sentenced to 10
years R.I. and fined Rs. 500/- and to further undergo a sentence to fifteen days of simple
imprisonment in default thereof. For the latter offence, he has been sentenced to life
imprisonment and fined Rs. 2,000/- and to further undergo two months simple imprisonment in
default thereof.
The brief facts of the case are that on 7.9.2000 Chhala Ram (PW-1) lodged a report (Ex.P. 1) at
Police Station, Chirawa wherein he claimed that ""his young son Mintu, aged eight years, was
missing from the afternoon of 2.9.2000. The boy had left the house at 12'O clock in order to
play. However, when the boy did not return back home till 7'O clock in the evening, he started to
search for him. He was told that the child was seen leaving the house of Jai Prakash and after that
he was not seen. Therefore, on 3.9.2000 he had filed a report for the missing child. He further
claimed that in the morning of the 7th, at 6'0 clock, some of the villagers gathered and they
started searching near the river. Around 9'O clock Bakhtawar and Jainarain Sharma, who went
on the east side of the river among the tall grasses, discovered the dead body of his son and his
clothes. He suspected that someone has killed his son. On the basis of the said report the police
chalked out a former FIR, FIR No. 226/2000, and commenced the investigation. On the same
day, the appellant was arrested as some of the witnesses had stated that they had seen the
deceased on the last occasion with the appellant. Eventually, the police filed a charge-sheet for
the offences under Section 377 and 302 IPC against the appellant. In order to prove its case the
prosecution examined 15 witnesses and submitted 29 documents. Although the defence did not
examine any witness, but it did submit the statement of Bakhtawar recorded under Section 161
Cr.P.C. as a document. After considering the oral and documentary evidence, the learned trial
court was pleased to convict and sentence the appellant as aforementioned.
Mr. S.P. Poshwal, the learned Amicus Curiae has argued that the case is based solely on
circumstantial evidence. However, the circumstances do not form a complete chain which
unerringly points towards the appellant's guilt. He has further claimed that there is a distance of
almost one Km. from the place where the deceased and the appellant were seen together and the
place from where the body of the deceased was eventually discovered. Therefore, the evidence of
""last seen"" is a weak evidence. Moreover according to the prosecution story the child was not
only so-domised but his head was decapitated from the body. However, the prosecution neither
explained the manner of decapitation nor recovered any weapon by which the head was severed.
Furthermore, there is no evidence to prove that the appellant had sodomized the child prior to his

death. Hence, the prosecution has failed to prove the twin offences under Section 377 and 302
IPC beyond a reasonable doubt.
On the other hand Mr. R.P. Kuldeep, the learned P.P., has argued that the prosecution has
completed the chain of circumstances by cogent and reliable evidence. Therefore, the learned
trial court was justified in convicting the appellant for the aforementioned offences. Hence, he
has supported the impugned judgment.
In the case of State of U.P. v. Satish , the Hon'ble Supreme Court has summarized the factors,
which must be satisfied before a conviction can be recorded on the basis of circumstantial
evidence:
Firstly, the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn, must be
cogently and firmly established; secondly, those circumstances should be of definite tendency
unerringly pointing towards guilt of the accused; thirdly, the circumstances, taken cumulatively
should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all
human probability the crime was committed by the accused, fourthly, the circumstantial evidence
in order to sustain conviction must be complete and incapable of explanation of any other
hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused and such evidence should not only be consistent
with the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence.
Therefore, while appreciating the evidence in the present case we need to consider whether the
prosecution has established the individual links of the circumstances by cogent evidence and
whether these circumstances unerringly point to the appellant's guilt.
PW-2, Ram Singh, who is an uncle of the deceased, testified that on 2.9.2000 when he and his
nephew, Nand Lal, were going from their farm, they saw the deceased and the appellant going
together towards the river. He further states that in the evening when Mintu did not come back
home, his brother and he both went to the appellant's house. There, the appellant's mother
informed them that Mintu was at their house till the afternoon and after that he went with the
appellant. Similarly PW-7, Bakhtawar Singh states that when he went to the appellant's house
around 11-11.30 A.M., he saw Mintu sitting with Omprakash and Jai Prakash at the appellant's
house. Likewise, in the statement of PW-8, Nandlal, claims that as he was passing by the

appellant's house he saw Jai Prakash leaving with the deceased and going towards the river. PW-
12 Hiralal also states that on 2.9.2000 when he went to Jaiprakash's house he saw Jaiprakash and

Mintu sleeping on the same cot. PW-8 Nandlal also tells that Mintu and the appellant are
distantly related to each other as uncle and nephew. These witnesses clearly prove that the
deceased was ""last seen"" with the appellant. Chhalaram, PW-1, further tells us that on 2.9.2000,
in the evening he went to the appellant's house and met him. the appellant told him that Mintu
had gone with him to answer the call of nature, had come back with him to the house and left
later on. Accordingly to this witness, the appellant had also gone with him to search for the boy.
Again according to the PW-1, Chhalaram, the child had disappeared on 2.9.2000 and his body

was not discovered till 7.9.2000 i.e. after a period of almost 5 days. According to the Post-
Mortem Report(Ex.P. 14), death had occurred 4 or 5 days earlier. According to the said Report,

the cause of death was asphyxia. Furthermore, on the place of buttocks there was a lacerated skin

margin oval in shape 10cm x 10cm x 10cm around at the expected anal point. According to the
Report, the head was decapitated and the head was brought separately with the body. PW-6 Dr.
L.K. Sharma has proved the said Report. Thus, both according to the testimony of Medical Jurist
as well as according to the Report, Mintu's death was homicidal in nature.
According to the doctor's opinion it appeared that the appellant had sex about 4-5 days before the
drawing up of the medical report. There is even a hand-written note at the bottom of the report
wherein it is clearly stated that ""1 had sexual intercourse with a boy on 2.9.2000"". The said
statement has been signed by the appellant himself. This statement has been given by the
appellant to the doctor when he was produced before the doctor for his medical examination.
This statement may not qualify as an extra-judicial confession made by the appellant, but it does
amount to an admission that the appellant had committed sodomy on 2.9.2000.
The prosecution has, thus proved that the deceased was last seen with the appellant. The
appellant had not only offered a false explanation, but had also joined the search party so as to
prove his innocence. The appellant's private parts had sustained injuries. The appellant also
admitted that he had sodomy with a boy on 2.9.2000. Hence, the child was subjected to sodomy.
The child had died due to asphyxia. Hence, his death was homicidal. Section 106 of the
Evidence Act imposes a burden on the accused to prove the fact which is especially within his
knowledge.
In the instant case it was within the especial knowledge of the appellant to tell the court as to
what happened to the deceased after the deceased was last seen with him on 2.9.2000. Although
the deceased has given intelligent answers to the questions put to him under Section 313 Cr.P.C.,
he has not given any explanation about what happened to the deceased after he was last seen
with the appellant. He merely denies the fact and states that ""I did not take Mintu with me"". In
the teeth of cogent and convincing evidence, he denies the factum of last seen. Hence, the
appellant has failed to discharge the burden under Section 106 of the Evidence Act.
Section 114 of the Evidence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had
to the common course of natural events and human conduct In their relation to the facts of the
particular case. The fact of last seen, the fact that the appellant's private parts were Injured, the
fact that there is lacerated wounds around the anal part of the deceased child, the fact that the
deceased was killed 4-5 days earlier, the fact that according to the doctor's opinion, the appellant
had sexual intercourse 4-5 days earlier and the Fact of admission leads us to safely conclude that
the appellant had committed sodomy with the deceased child. According to the Post-Mortem
Report, the cause of death is asphyxia. Therefore, we are convinced that the appellant had
committed the murder of the child. All the circumstantial evidence unerringly point towards the
guilt of the accused and are inconsistent with his innocence.",,Jai Prakash  Prakash vs State Of Rajasthan on 22 February 2006,"[ 0.5353067  -0.24052191 -0.614157   -0.65762454 -0.13503638 -0.31618455

68 by which the learned judge allowed the writ application filed bv M/s. Martinhail Ex-
Service-men Cooperative Transport Society Ltd., Khetri (which is the only contesting

respondent before us) and which will be referred to as ""Society"" hereinafter for the sake of
brevity"". The resolution of the Regional Transport Authority, dated 22/23rd December,
1967, has been set aside and the permits for stage carriage granted to the appellants in appeals
Nos. 33, 34 and 35 on Jaipur-Khetri route have been cancelled. The Society has been told 'to
decide the application of the Society, as also of other applicants like the (Society) if pending'.
Appeal No. 36 of 1968 has been preferred by the Regional Transport Authority, but the
parties who are really aggrieved and who in fact are adversely affected are the appellants in
appeals Nos. 33, 34 and 35 of 1963. The parties to whom permits have been granted are
referred to as ""appellants"" for the sake of brevity.
The Society is an existing operator along with 19 others on Jhunihunu-Nim-ka-Thana route.
Their applications were published in Rajasthan Rajpatra dated 21-4-66 under notification
dated 2-2-66. Some new applicants including the appellants also applied for fresh permits on

Jaipur-Khetri Copper Mines route. The applications for extension of the route.nJhunjhunu-
Nim-ka-Thana to Jaipur as well as those for grant of fresh permits on.Jaipur-Khetri route

would be considered together. In the meeting held on 8-11-67 it was observed that all the
items after item No. 2/105 would be taken up in the next meeting of 21-12-67. By resolution
No. 30 (item No. 2/31) dated 16-9-67 the Regional Transport Authority resolved that the
applications for extension of the route Jhunjhunu-Nim-ka-Thana to Jaipur as well as those for
grant of fresh permits onJaipur-Khetri route would be considered together. These applications
were also published. By subsequent resolutions dated 20-10-67 and 21-12-67, the Regional
Transportation Authority directed that ""all the applications (for different vias of Jaipuri
Khetri Copper Project route) may be sorted out end put up"".
Planning permission will be granted for the extension of Jhunjhunu-Nim-ka-Thana route and
grant of fresh permits over Jaipur-Khetri Copper Mines route on 21-12-67. A meeting of the
Regional Transport Committee (RTC) will be held on the same date to discuss the issue.
Regional Transport Authority could not be held for want of quorum and was adjourned to 22-
12-67. Authority considered applications of appellants as well as other persons, who had

applied for permit on Jaipur-Khetri Copper Mines route. It granted 18 permits to non-
petitioners in writ application and postponed the consideration of Society's application.

Regional Transport Authority could not be held for want of quorum and was adjourned to 22-
12-67. Authority considered applications of appellants as well as other persons, who had

applied for permit on Jaipur-Khetri Copper Mines route. It granted 18 permits to non-
petitioners in writ application and postponed the consideration of Society's application.

The judge held that the route for which the appellants have been granted permits lies on a
common highway and one of the two terminii of the same route is also common. There is no
difficulty in the conclusion that if one set of applications is taken up and decided in advance
of the other then the remaining applications are bound to be affected. In this view of the
matter, the cases previously decided by this court were in respect of the same two .The

principle laid down in those cases would apply to the present case also. The learned Judge
found that the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) was in error in deciding the applications
of the appellants by the impugned resolution, therefore, he quashed the RTA's decision and
also cancelled the permits granted to them.
There is no dispute that both the routes for the society and the Indian Kanoon have only one
common terminus - Jaipur - beyond dispute that they lie on a common highway. The parties'
application for fresh permit has not been challenged before the Court of India's High Court.
Mr. Rastogi, counsel for the appellants in appeal No. 33/68, has argued that the Regional
Transport Authority had not committed any error of jurisdiction or a patent error of law in
deciding the applications of the appellants first so as to justify interference by the issue of a
writ of certiorari. In support of his contention he has placed strong reliance on an unreported
decision of the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 762 of 1963.
The learned counsel for the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland has pressed with vehemence
for the application of the principle of simultaneous consideration and disposal of all
applications for the same route laid down by this court in earlier cases. On the other hand, the
learned counsel from the Society has argued that no just exception can be made to the view
taken by the learned single Judge.
In Nathdwara v. Regional Transport Authority, Udaipur decided on 12th August 1957 (Raj),
the then Chief Justice, speaking for the court, observed that no publication was made of the
applications filed by the applicants. The applicants in that case had applied for permits on
five routes namely. Kankroli-Desuri, Nathwara-Bhilwara, Kankapla-Thoriya, Ghata-Kelwara
and Nathdwar-Gaogura.
In the first case, M/s Brothers Transport Service, Nathdwara v. Udaipur-Bhilwara (Civil Writ
Petn. No. 199 of 1956, D/- 12-8-1957, (Raj) (supra) the learned judges held that all the
applications for new route should have been considered together. The non-petitioners in that
case, it so appears, tried to justify the action of the Regional Transport Authority by saying
that the petitioner no. 1 had applied only for extension of route and not for permits on the
new route. But the finding of the court was that the petitioner wanted new permits for the new
routes.
It was held that all applications for permits on the Udaipur-Bhilwara route should have been
decided together, as in Brothers' v Nathdwara (Civil Writ Petn. No. 199 of 1956, D/- 12-8-
1957. It was also held that Shyam Singh v. Regional Transport Authority (1960) 10 Raj 1669.
In this case too the petitioner Shyam Singh had moved for issue of a writ against the regional
transport authority.
Bhonrilal v. Regional Transport Authority, Jaipur, 1967. Raj LW 481. The petitioner's
contention was that his application for issue of permit for the route in question, was not
published. The learned Judges held that the principle laid down in Brothers Transport
Service, Nathdwara's case, Civil Writ Petn. No. 199 of 1956, had full application.
In Surendra Kumar Sharma v. Regional Transport Authority, Jaipur Region, Civil Writ Petn.
No. 460 of 1967 = (AIR 1968 Raj 294) decided by one of us sitting singly on 20th Dec. 1967,
an application for grant of permit on Beawar-Todgarh route was considered along with the
application of the opposite party Chelaram. It was held in this case that if.more than one
applications are pending and are ripe for consideration, then there is no need to consider only
one and postpone the rest.
Civil Writ Petn. No. 657 of 1967) decided on 16th April, 1968(Raj). The writ application
filed in this case pertained to Alwar-Pahadi route and there was no dispute between the

parties regarding the route. The grievance of the petitioner was that although his application
had become ripe for consideration, the Regional Transport Authority did not consider it.
The Malwa Co-operative Society and certain other Motor Transport operators applied to the
Regional Transport Authority for grant of a permit for Burhanpur-Indore route in 1958.
While these applications were pending, Purshottam Bhai Bhai Patel and Babulal applied for
an identical route via Indore. These two routes were identical upto a long distance but
overlapping. Patel and Babulal's application for extension of the route from Burhanpur to
Ujjain was rejected by the Regional Transport Authority. The High Court set aside the order
of the Tribunal and the Society filed appeal to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court held that the Tribunal cannot be said to have ignored the terms of Section
47 (1) (c) in making the impugned order. There was no error of law in the order to justify
interference by the High Court by the issue of a writ of certiorari. The applicants for
extension of the route from Indore to Ujjain were distinct matters, which ought to have been
considered separately.
Mr Sen's submission was that each application for the grant of a permit constituted a separate
proceeding which had to be dealt with in isolation and without regard to other applications
pending at the same time. The learned Single Judge held that it would have been an error on
the part of Transport Authorities to have considered such pending applications while making
orders on applications being heard and decided under Section 57 (5). Supreme Court: ""We
are unable as at present advised to accept the submission in the absolute form, he presented"".
Learned Counsel for the appellants has not argued that Bhonri Lal's case is no longer good
law. The impact of Purshottam Rhai's case, Civil Appeal No. 762 of 1963 was not brought to
the Supreme Court's attention. Section 47 (1) (c) requires that in considering an application
for a stage carriage permit the Regional Transport Authority must have regard to the
adequacy of other passenger transport services. The words ""between the places to be served""
refer to the two termini which are not the same in the present case. The writ was filed by the
Society for the Protection of Indian Railways (SPIR) against the Transport Authority's
decision to grant 18 permits for extension of the route between Jhunjhunu and Jaipur.
Spokesman for the Society said: We are of the view that different considerations may apply
at the time of granting permits for through or direct service.
The Society for Indian Railways (Society) and the appellants had applied for the same route.
Learned Counsel for the Society was at pains to submit that the two termini of the routes
were different and distinct from each other. We do not think it necessary to enter into the
discussion of the question as to what are the implications of the term ""route"".Mr Rastogi's
submission that each application for the grant of a permitconstituted a separate proceeding
had to be dealt with in isolation and without regard to the pending applications for the same
or related routes was rejected by the Supreme Court. Their Lordships' decision does not lead
to the conclusion that it would be an error on the part of Transport Authorities to consider
such pending applications while making orders on pending applications. ""If it were held that.
immediately an application is made for a permit on a route which is the same as. that for
which applications are being considered by the Transport Authority under Section 57 (5)
or.which might have a material bearing on the grant of permits on that route, the. public
would be deprived of a transport service for appreciable length of time and this could
not.have been contemplated by the Act.""
The permits granted to the appellants in the present case cannot be quashed on the grounds
that the Society's application and applications of other applicants for extension of their routes
were postponed. Decision for surveying the routes between Jhunjhunu to Jaipur had been
taken by the Regional Transport Authority as far back as 1965.

The Society of Engineers argued that it did not have the legal right to challenge the permits
granted to the appellants by a writ application in view of the fact that it had not filed any
objections to their applications. The Learned Single Judge held that it was not necessary for
the Society to have filed a separate representation against the other applicants. Counsel for
the Society also directed his attack against four appellants individually. It was urged that the
appellants Mohammed Yusuf and Saved Ahmed in Appeal No. 34 of 1868, have applied for a
different route namely Jaipur to Khetri Copper Mines via Chomu-Sikar.
The net result of our findings is that the Appeals Nos. 33 of 1968 and 35 of 1968 are allowed
and the judgment of the learned Single Judge dated 11-7-1968 is set aside. The Appeal No.
34 of 1968 filed by the appellants Saved Ahmed and Mohammed Yusuf is dismissed and the
order of the.learned Single Judge cancelling the permits granted to these appellants is
maintained, though for different reasons.
All the four appeals are disposed
of accordingly. In the circumstances of
the case we leave all the parties to bear
their own costs.",,Dwarka Das and Sons And Ors vs Regional Transport Authorityon 10 September 1968,"[-4.28483486e-01 -1.02557659e+00 -7.36607388e-02 -5.02481222e-01

1988.",1,1,,"This petition has been filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
(Cr.P.C.) praying that the summoning order dated 4th November, 2019 in R.C. No.219/2016-
E-0003-16 be set aside.
The petitioner No.1 was previously posted as Deputy General Manager with the Oriental
Bank of Commerce (now Punjab National Bank) whereas petitioners No.2 & 4 are posted as
Manager and Senior Manager respectively in the same bank. A written Signature Not
Verified Digitally Signed By:MANJEET KAUR Signing Date:22.07.2022 17:08:57
complaint had been submitted by the Deputy General Manager, Oriental Bank of Commerce,
Regional Office, Karol Bagh, Sh. Ravinder Yadav against Sh. Sanjay Khanna, Sh. Prem Nath
Khanna and Sh. Sandeep Khanna, who are partners of M/s Adigear India, Smt. Amarjeet
Kaur and other unknown officials of the Oriental Bank of Commerce, LU Branch, Pitampura
and other unknown persons. On the basis of this complaint, the Economic Offences Wing-I of
the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered an FIR against all of them under
Sections 120B/420 IPC and 13(1) (d) read with 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act,
1988.
The charge-sheet was filed against the accused showing the present petitioners in column
No.12 as no sanction was granted by the competent authority to prosecute them. The
grievance of the petitioners is that despite an absence of sanction, they have been summoned
for committing the offence under Section 120B read with Sections 420/468/471 IPC and the
substantive offence of Section 420 IPC.
Mr. Mohit Mathur, learned senior counsel for the petitioners, submitted that the learned Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM), Rouse Avenue Court, had incorrectly summoned the
petitioners in the absence of any sanction being granted for their prosecution. Attention has
been drawn 7th to the Office Memorandum (Annexure-E) dated February, 2018 issued by the
Advisor to the Oriental Bank of Commerce, to the effect that there was no evidence or proof
of obtaining gain by the petitioners or any act of Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed
By:MANJEET KAUR Signing Date:22.07.2022 17:08:57 dishonesty, corrupt practice on
their part. Hence, there was no criminal intent discernable in their acts, warranting criminal
proceedings in the court of law. Therefore, the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) through
the Advisor declined grant of sanction for their prosecution.
Depending on the decision in Ashoo Surendranath Tewari Vs. The Dy. Superintendent of
Police, EOW, CBI & others, (2020) 9 SCC 636, the learned senior counsel urged that the
report of the CVC ought not to have been brushed aside so easily and the exoneration by the
CVC had to be considered by the learned CMM and instead of summoning the petitioners,
they ought to have been discharged. Reliance has also been placed on the decision in Anirudh
Sen Vs. State of NCT of Delhi, 2006 SCC OnLine Del 1362, to contend that when there was
no material on the record to connect the petitioners with the commission of the alleged
offences, they could not have been summoned. It was also argued that the FIR had been
registered for the commission of offences under Section 120B read with Section 420 IPC and
13(2) read with Section 13(1) (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and the CMM
was not the designated court to have dealt with the charge-sheet. Therefore, the summoning

order dated 4th November, 2019 was passed without jurisdiction and was liable to be set
aside.
Mr. Anil Grover, learned counsel for the respondent/CBI contended that though the FIR had
been registered for the offences under Section 120B read with Section 420 IPC and 13(2)
read with Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, however, after due
investigations, the charge-sheet was filed for the commission of offences Signature Not
Verified Digitally Signed By:MANJEET KAUR Signing Date:22.07.2022 17:08:57 under
Section 120B read with Sections 420/467/468/471 IPC and the learned CMM was fully
empowered to deal with the charge-sheet and lacked no jurisdiction.
Further submitted that the sanction was essential for prosecution under the Prevention of
Corruption Act, but was not required qua the petitioners under Section 197 Cr.P.C. Reliance
has been placed on the judgment in S.K. Miglani Vs. State of NCT of Delhi, (2019) 6 SCC
111. Reliance has also been placed on the judgment in Md. Hadi Raja Vs. State of Bihar,
(1998) 5 SCC 91 to contend that employees of a Public Sector Undertaking could not be
equated to those of a government department and the protection of sanction under Section
197 Cr.P.C. was not available to them. Reliance has been placed on the decision of the
Supreme Court in Punjab Warehousing Corporation Vs. Bhushan Chander, (2016) 13 SCC 44
in this respect.
It is noted that the contention of the learned senior counsel for the petitioners that the learned
CMM, Rouse Avenue Court has no jurisdiction to deal with the charge-sheet, cannot be
accepted.The fact is that the charge-sheet has been filed for the commission of the offences
under the IPC ,Section 120B read with Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed
By:MANJEET KAUR Signing Date:22.07.2022 17:08:57 Sections 420/467/468/471 IPC and
substantive offences thereof. It does not matter that the FIR itself was registered also under
the Prevention of Corruption Act.
The charge-sheet has listed them in column No.12 were accused of offences under Sections
120B/420/467/468 IPC and Sections 13(2) and 13(1)(D) of the Prevention of Corruption Act
and substantive offences thereof. But as noticed, the charge-sheet does not include any
allegation in respect of the acts of corruption.
The learned senior counsel for the petitioners on the Office Memorandum dated 7th February,
2018, whereby, Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:MANJEET KAUR Signing
Date:22.07.2022 17:08:57 the CVC/Advisor declined grant of sanction of prosecution against
the petitioners not just for corrupt practices, but also for offences under the IPC, finding no
act of dishonesty, fraud or conspiracy against them. The learned senior counsel sought to rely
on the information received under the Right to Information Act, 2005.
The analysis of the case was observed that there was no evidence or proof against the

An order of detention under s. 3 (2) of the Maintenance of Internal SecurityAct, 1971, has
been upheld by the Court of Appeal in Belfast. The petition contended that the detention was
mala fide because the detainee was detained after his discharge by the court for want of
evidence. If a detaining authority takes the chance of conviction and falls back on its power
to punish someone whom the court would not convict, it is an abuse and virtual nullification
of the judicial process. No ground exists for dismissing this statement as sham or factitious.
Judgment delivered by KRISHNA IYER, J.-. A few issues of some moment, in the context of
civil liberties have been argued in this application for habeas corpus. Golam Hussain alias
Gama was detained under S. 3(1) (a) (ii) read with sub-section (2) of the Maintenance of
Internal Security Act 1971 (Act 26 of 1971). On 8-10-72 at about 22-25 hrs., you along with
associates Achche Lal Show of 1, Manickotolla Bazar Lane, Satya Narayan Jaiswal of 123/2,
Acharya Prafulla in Chandra Road, and others, all being armed with bombs, soda- water
bottles created a great disturbance of public order.
""If left free and unfettered you are likely to continue to disturb manitenance of public order
by acting in a similar manner as aforesaid"". The detenu's case was placed before the Advisory
Board on August 13, 1973. Order confirming detention was made by the State Government
on September 28, 1973 and communicated to them by October 1973.
The Commissioner of Police who passed the detention order has stated in his affidavit that
there were cases connected with ,he incidents of October 8th and November 9th, but the
detenu could not be arrested until July 4, 1973. This charge has been repudiated by the
Commissioner on oath. Counsel argued that because the grounds of detention have been the
subject matter of criminal cases, therefore, the order of detention is malafide. The basic
imperative of proof beyond reasonable doubt does not apply to the 'subjective satisfaction'
component, of imprisonment for reasons of internal security. No mechanical test by counting
the months of the interval is sound. It all depends on the nature of the acts relied on, grave
and determined or less serious and corrigible. We have to investigate whether the causal
connection has been broken in the circumstances of each case.

If the detaining authority takes the chance of conviction and, when the court verdict goes
against it, falls back on its detention power to punish one whom the court would not convict.
But if honestly finding a dangerous person getting away with it by overawing witnesses or
concealing the commission cleverly an authority may validly direct detention. Shri Chatterjee
argues that detention without a period is violative of s. 12 of the Act. M. S. Khan v C. C.
Bose, (1) Ashim Kumar v. State of West Bengal, and Sahib Singh Dugal v Union of India are
precedents.
Section 1(3) of the Defence of India Act, 1971 laid down the duration of that Act. Section 13
of the MISA specifies the maximum period of detention. The Court dismissed a similar
argument in Suna Ullah v. State of J & K (1). Section 12 of the Act provides that the
Government may confirm the detention of a person if there is sufficient cause. There is
nothing in the section which enjoins upon the Government to specify the period of detention.
The period for which a person can be detained after the confirmation of the detention order is
subject to the limit of two years.

The period for which a person can be detained after the confirmation of the detention order is

""If the specification of the period of detention is 'not at all sacrosanct' why is the specification
of a period to be regarded as virtually or at all necessary?"". asks Mr Justice Rangana, S.C.R.
612. If we insist on a specification of a definite period when the confirmatory order is in a
deand there after each time the period of detention is extended then the appropriate
Government will have to apply its mind to the case of the detenu before it will make an order
for further extension. Patanjali Sastri, C. J., concurred with Mukherjea J.'s decision. The
question now is whether the omission to state the period of further detention while
confirming the detention order under section II (1) of the Preventive Detention Act makes it
illegal.
Section II (1) of the Preventive Detention Act does contemplate that a period should be
mentioned during which the further detention of the detwnu is to continue, but I am unable to
ho ld that this omission alone would make the order a nullity. Civil liberty ordinarily ends
where detention without trial begins and commitment to the rule of law receives a rude shock
where a permanent statute authorises long term gaol confinement. That is why courts have
been strict even on procedural steps in the past. The history of personal liberty is largely the
history of insistence on procedure. The need today for maintenance of supplies and services
essential to the community cannot be over-emphasised. Observance of procedure has been
the bastion against wanton assaults on personal liberty over the years, writes Justice John
Chisholm in The Times of India.
""It would indeed be ironic if, in the name of social security, we would sanction the
subversion of personal liberty,"" writes Shri Ramachandra Guha in his review of Lohia's (l)
detention under the Social Security and Public Safety Act. A criminal act hitting a private
target such as indecent assult of a woman or slapping a neighbour or knocking down a

pedestrian while driving may not shake up public order. But a striking worker armed with a
dagger stabbing a blackleg during a bitter strike spreading terror-these are invasions of public
order although the motivation may be against a particular individual.
The petition was dismissed on the grounds that detention by executive fiat is an erosion of a
great right. Another argument, rather flimsy, was made that a corrigendum reading 'public
order' in the place of 'police order' was not communicated to the detenu.",,Golam Hussain Alias Gama vs The Commissioner Of Police on 15 March 1974,"[-0.07386176  0.01020972  0.01546066 -0.07646511 -0.39617163  0.8951262

and Sessions Judge.
The accused was working as a Physical Training Teacher in a School at Chennai. PW1, aged
about 9 years was studying 4th standard in the same School. Allegedly subjected to sexual
assault by the accused while she attended a physical training class in the ground on 2.7.2003. On
examination, the Doctor, PW8 found swelling and PW1 complained pain in her private part. The
Doctor also found fungus infection in it. Inspector of Police has made a requisition to the Court
for sending PW1 for medical examination.
Inspector of Police laid the charge sheet against the accused on 17.9.2003 for the offence under
Sections 376(2)(f) IPC. He has issued the Certificate, Ex.P10 stating that there is nothing to
suggest that he is impotent.
The prosecution in order to bring home the charge against the accused, examined PWs.1 to 9 and
filed Exs.P1 to P12.
When the accused was questioned under Section 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code, in
respect of incriminating materials appearing against him, through the evidence adduced by the
prosecution, he came forward with the version of total denial. He has examined DWs.1 & 2 on
his side.
Advocate for the appellant has said that the prosecution failed to prove its case by adducing clear
and consistent evidence. Accused of outraging the modesty of the prosecutrix, PW1 is made out
against the appellant. Pleaded for leniency in sentence saying he has studied L.L.M. etc.
Counsel appearing for Mr.J.C.Durairaj, learned Government Advocate (Crl.side) submitted that
the prosecution has proved its case by adducing clear and cogent evidence through PWs.1 to 4. It
is contended that the Medical Certificate discloses the injuries sustained by PW1 and as such the
version of PW1 is corroborated by the medical evidence.
I have given my careful consideration to the rival contentions put forward by either side and
thoroughly scanned through the entire evidence available to me.

The accused was working in the same School as Physical Training Master. The prosecutrix is a
child aged about 9 years and she was studying 4th standard. The occurrence is said to have taken
place while she was attending physical training class in the playground of her High School.
In this case, the prosecution has relied heavily on the testimony of the prosecutrix, PW1 and her
father, PW2 and the medical evidence through the Doctors, PWs.6 & 8, to test the credibility of
their version. It is relevant to refer to the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in
respect of reliability of the evidence of the prosecutors.
Corroboration of testimony of the prosecutrix is not a requirement of law but a guidance of
prudence under the given facts and circumstances. The Hon'ble Apex Court in Sudhansu Sekhar
Sahoo v. State of Orissa reported in AIR 2003 SC 2136, held that corroboration is not required
for conviction. A prosecutrix of a sex-offence cannot be put on par with an accomplice. She is in
fact a victim of the crime. The Evidence Act nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted
unless it is corroborated in material particulars, writes RK Agrawal.
This Court has no hesitation to hold that the evidence of PW1 inspires the confidence of this
Court. The report, Ex.P1 was given by PW2, the father of the prosecutrix, PW1. It is categorical
version of PW2 that PW1 fell ill on 17.6.2003 and was taken to the doctor by her father. The
prosecution also examined the Doctor, PW6 attached to the Madras Medical College Hospital.
She has categorically stated that the prosecutrix, PW1 was subjected to sexual assault. The
version of PW1 is further corroborated by the landlady, PW3 and her sister, PW4.
The prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused has committed the heinous
crime of rape on the minor child, PW1. The learned counsel for the appellant made a feeble
attempt to contend that even assuming the accused indulged in sexual assault on PW1, the same
would attract the offence of outraging the modesty of the victim. The victim is a small child aged
about 9 years. She was also threatened by the accused that her father and mother would be killed
if she told anyone. The report was given even prior to the medical examination by the Doctor,
PW6 on 7.7.2003.
Delay in lodging the first information report cannot be used as a ritualistic formula for doubting
the prosecution case. The principle laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the decision cited
supra is squarely applicable to the facts of the instant case. Even assuming that there is some
delay, it is only due to the threat said to have been given to the victim.
This Court is of the considered view that the impugned judgment of conviction does not suffers
from any infirmity. A child aged about 9 years was mercilessly subjected to rape by her own
Physical Training Master in the School. The offence of rape is not only against an individual, but
also against the society. Child abuse cases particularly increasing in schools, according to
National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR). Complaints on child excesses in
schools have nearly tripled in the past three years. Tamil Nadu saw a surge in complaints last
year and received 95 complaints in 2009-2010 (till date).

Court is constrained to highlight the services rendered by Childline India Foundation (C.I.F)
founded in June 1996. The CHILDLINE number 1098 is a 24-hour, free emergency telephone
helpline for children in distress between the age group of 0-18 years.",,Rangesh Accused vs State By Inspector Of Police on 27 August 2010,"[ 0.33678013  0.19945432 -0.37011626 -0.42098144 -0.40579423 -0.3279876

""Honourable acquittal"", ""acquitted of blame"" and ""fully exonerated"" are unknown to the

acquitted or conviction and it reads as follows: "" Acquittal or Conviction"".

to the Sessions Judge for the purposes of this Sub-Section and of Section 398. The High Court
may, in its discretion, exercise any of the powers conferred on a Court of Appeal by Sections
386, 389, 390 and 391 or an Court of Session by Section 397. The High Court may treat an
application for revision as a petition of appeal and deal with the same accordingly. Where under
this Code an appeal lies but no application has been made to the High Court by any person, it
may be satisfied that such application was made under the erroneous belief that no appeal lies.
Section 401(1) confers upon the High Court, the same powers as available to a Court of Appeal.
This is subject to the restrictions contained in Sub-Sections (2) to (5) of Section 401. The High

Court may alter or reverse such an order. In an appeal from a conviction, the Court may reverse
the finding and sentence and acquit or discharge the accused, or order him to be re-tried. It may
also alter the nature or the extent, or the nature and extent, of the sentence, so as to enhance or
reduce the same.
Appellate Court is entitled to amend the order of ""benefit of doubt acquittal"" into one of
""honourable acquittal"". Learned counsel contended that by such (doubtful) acquittals, the human
rights of individuals are affected and cast a stigma upon the person, who is acquitted only on
benefit of doubt.
Sir James Fritzjames Stephen, the father of the Indian Evidence Act has stated that in criminal
cases guilt ought to be proved ""beyond all reasonable doubt"". The danger of punishing the
innocent is marked by the use of the expression ""no doubt,"" the necessity of running some degree
of risk in certain cases is intimated by the word ""reasonable"". ""The ultimate question in judicial
proceedings is and must be a question of prudence,"" writes Mr. Mill. In all cases the known facts
must be arranged and classified with reference to the different hypotheses, or unknown or
suspected facts. If more than one hypothesis is consistent with the knowns facts, but one only is
reasonably probable, that case is proved.
The principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of the common law
of England and no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained. In Ceylon, where the mode of
proof is clearly spelt out, it is impossible to suppose that there can be more than one kind of
burden of proof.
The concept of 'proof beyond reasonable doubt' and 'benefit of doubt' have been imported into
our Criminal Jurisprudence. In a criminal case, it is the burden on the prosecution to prove
various relevant facts. If the Judge has a reasonable doubt about coming to the inference in
respect of the fact in issue, then only the benefit of that doubt should be extended to the accused.
Benefit of doubt is not a legal dosage to be administered at every segment of the evidence, but an
advantage to be afforded to the accused at the final end after consideration of the entire evidence.
A criminal court could be convinced of the guilt only beyond the range of a reasonable doubt.
The Courts came to realise that there are varying degrees of the scope of balance of probabilities
in civil cases. In Hornal v Neuberger Products Ltd. [1957 (1) QB 247], the plaintiff claimed
damages for breach of warranty or alternatively for fraud. The Court of Appeal has overturned
Denning's decision in Bater v Bater, which dismissed damages for fraud. The claim was
dismissed on the ground that he was satisfied on a balance of probabilities, but not beyond
reasonable doubt that the statement was made and accordingly, awarded damages.
In the case of Addington v. Texas, Chief Justice Burger referred to the standards of proof in legal
cases in the following manner. The evolution of this area of the law has produced across a
continuum three standards or levels of proof. One typical use of the intermediate standard is in
civil cases involving allegations of fraud or quasi-criminal wrongdoing by the defendant. The

standard has come to be referred to as an ?enhanced balance of probabilities? This intermediate
standard was considered in Canada in the case of Re: Robinson and Hislop (1981) 114 DLR (3d)
620.
In 1982, the Supreme Court of Canada decided the case of Continental Insurance Co. v. Dalton
Cartage Co. The Court held that even where there is an allegation of conduct that is morally
blameworthy, the relevant burden of proof remains proof on a balance of probabilities. The
British Columbia Court of Appeal overturned a judge's decision in a civil case. The matter went
to the Supreme Court of Canada. Justice Rothstein said there is only one civil standard of proof
at common law and that is proof on a balance of probabilities. He cited problems with
alternatives to the balance of probability test.
Justice Rothstein: There is only one legal rule and that in all cases, evidence must be scrutinized

with care by the trial judge. The ultimate truth as to how the standards of proof affect decision-
making may well be unknowable? He also said that adopting a standard of proof is more than an

empty semantic exercise. The Courts cannot and do not work with mathematical precision. If the
party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, a value of 0 is returned and the fact is
treated as not having happened. If he does discharge it and proves it, is treated as having
happened.
An artificial dichotomy was created and it slowly crept into the system of administration of
justice. In cases where the decision to acquit could not have been reached by applying the civil
standard, there was a temptation to brand those acquittals as something inferior to the other form.
In criminal jurisprudence, there is no distinction between 'not proved' and 'disproved', as both
would result only in one consequence, namely acquittal. The different adjectives used by various
courts, to the acquittals granted by them, actually indicate the process of reasoning through
which they decide to acquit a person.
Appellate Court has wide range of powers under section 386 of the Indian Penal Code. It can
alter or reverse any order, depending upon whether it is an appeal from an acquittal or a
conviction. The petitioners' counsel contends that Section 386 is telescoped into Section 401,
which speaks about the High Court's power of revision. The Appellate Court has the power to
alter or reverse an order under Clause (b) of Section 386 of the Criminal Procedure Code. It can
do so in the following ways: (i) Alter the finding and sentence; (ii) Order him to be re-tried by a
competent Court; (iii) alter the finding, while maintaining the sentence; and (iv) enhance or
reduce the sentence.
Section 401(1) cannot be read in isolation from the various provisions for appeals available
under Sections 372 to 380 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Unless an appeal is maintainable,
the question of invocation of Clause (b) or Clause (e) of Section 386 would not arise. A
Revisional Court cannot do what an Appellate Court itself cannot do. If an appeal by an

acquitted person is not maintainable in law, we do not know how a revision, which is narrower in
scope than an appeal, could be maintained at the instance of such a person.
An order of acquittal will not come within the definition of the expression 'any other order'
appearing in Clause (d) of Section 386. Judgments are given under Chapter XXVII of the Code
and an acquittal does not fall within this definition. Therefore, the revisions filed by acquitted
persons, are not maintainable. VRSJ: The recourse that clever lawyers have invented in the past
six years, is not founded upon any of the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. Employers
tend to scan the judgments of acquittal of criminal courts before they venture to select a person
for appointment.
The flash of creative genius that came as a spark in 2008, inventing a remedy unavailable under
the Criminal Procedure Code, cannot survive for long. No appeal or petition can be entertained
for converting an order of acquittal passed by a Trial Court into an honourable acquittal. The bar
of entry into police force does not mean that opportunities in all other areas are also shut down.
Most of the times, the victims of crime suffer in silence. The State and the Director General of
Police should discard all suggestions for an amendment to the Rules.",,M Krishnan vs The State Through The Inspector Of on 25 September 2014,"[-2.09364548e-01  2.68732496e-02 -1.68126728e-02 -1.30273238e-01

Judicature for the State of Punjab at Simla. Civil Regular First Appeal No. 365 of 1946
arising out of the Decree in Suit No. 110 of 1945.
DAS J.-This is an appeal by the plaintiff in a suit for a declaration of his title as collateral
within&#39; four degrees of Gurdial, who was a Sarswat Brahmin. Rajinder Narain, for the
appellant. L. Gosain (R. S. Narula and Naunit Lal, with him), for the respondent.
Gurdial died leaving certain lands in villages Bhadroya, Kingarian and Pathankot. A
portion of the land was acquired for the Kangra Valley Railway. A sum of Rs. 1,539-7-0
was awarded to Musammat Melo.
On the 28th September 1944 Musammat Melo died and the Revenue Courts ordered
mutations in respect of the lands in the three villages in favour of the respondent as the
daughter of Gurdial.
Appeal was filed against the respondent for a declaration that he was entitled to the
lands mentioned in the plaint as well as to the sum of Rs. 1 539-7-0. The respondent
contested the suit mainly on the grounds that the suit for a mere declaration was not
maintainable.
The Subordinate Judge in his judgment pronounced on the 31st October 1946 held that
the lands in suit being in possession of tenants, the suit for a declaration of title was
maintainable but not for the sum of Rs. 1,539-7-0.
After the partition of India the appeal was transferred to the High Court of East Punjab.
The High Court modified the decree of the Subordinate Judge to relate only to the land

in Khata No. 2 of village Kingarian which was held to be ancestral. After the Con-
stitution of India, the appeal has come before this Court for final disposal.

The main issue before us is whether the lands in suit are ancestral or self- acquired.

We, therefore, see no force or substance in this contention. Rattigan&#39;s work has been
accepted by the Privy Council as &quot;a book of unquestioned authority in the Punjab.
Claims that the collaterals of one Harnam Singh, who was also a Sarswat Brahmin of
the Gurdaspur district, succeeded in preference to his daughter. The trial Court (1)
[1955] 1The High Court took the view that the evidence as to the succession to the
property of Harnam Singh was of no assistance to the appellant. The fact that the
daughter did not contest the succession of the collaterals to the properties left by her
father might well have been the result of some family arrangement.S.C R.C 86.

Appellant contends that he has discharged the onus that was on him by producing in
evidence the Riwaj-i-am recording the custom of the district of Gurdaspur. The answer
to question 16 is that subject to certain exceptions, the general rule is that the daughters
are excluded by the widow and male kindred. Onus has shifted to the respondent to
prove instances rebutting the Riwaj-i-am of the Gurdaspur district. The quantum of
evidence necessary to rebut that presumption will, however, vary with the facts and
circumstances of each case.
The presumption as to correctness of the Riwaj-i-am. ersely the rights of females who
had no opportunity whatever of appearing before the. Revenue authorities will be
weaker still. [See Khan Beg v Mt. Mt. (1) [1916] L.R. 44 I.A.
89.(2) [28] I.L.R 10 Lah 186). The Riwaj-i-ams of the Gurdaspur district in so far as they
purport to record local custom as to succession of daughters to their respective father&#39;s
property, are reliable and trustworthy documents. This principle has been followed by
the East Punjab High Court in the later case of Mohammad Khalil v Mohammad
Bakhsh.
Many of the questions in the 1913 Riwaj-i-am relate to matters on which there really
existed no custom. In Appendix &#39;C&#39; are collected 56 instances of mutuations in
which the
daughter inherited. Answer to question 16 discredited and shown to be incorrect in at
least three cases.

Basheshar Nath and Mt. Massan v. Sawan Mal. The

Indian Penal Code		

",1,1,,"A writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution has been filed by Sakshi. Sakshi provides
legal, medical, residential, psychological or any other help, assistance or charitable support
for women. The main reliefs claimed in the writ petition are as under:. Issue a writ declaring
inter alia that ""sexual intercourse"" includes all forms of penetration.
Penile/vaginal penetration as contained in section 375 of the Indian Penal Code shall include
all forms of penetration. Sexual abuse of minor children and women by penetration other than
penile-vaginal should be classed as unnatural offences under Sections 375, 376 and 376A to
376D.
Section 375/376 IPC only applies to cases of penile/vaginal penetration, which runs contrary
to the existing contemporary understanding of rape as an intent to humiliate, violate and
degrade a woman or child sexually. It adversely affects the sexual integrity and autonomy of
women and children in violation of Article 21 of the Constitution.
Section 375 IPC does not in any way limit the term penetration to mean penile/vaginal
penetration. It is submitted that by treating such forms of abuse as offences falling under
Section 354 IPC or 377 IPC, the very intent of the amendment of Section 376 IPC is
defeated.
The petition submits that there has for some time now been a growing body of feminist legal
theory and jurisprudence which has clearly established rape as an experience of humiliation,
degradation and violation. Restricting an understanding of rape in terms sought to be done by
the respondent authorities and its agents reaffirms the view that rapists treat rape as sex and
not violence.
Sexual assault in our day and age is hardly restricted to forced genital copulation, nor is it
exclusively a male-on-female offence. Sticks, bottles and even fingers are often substituted
for the ""natural"" thing. And as men may invade women through other orifices, so too, do they
invade other men.
Section 377 IPC was clearly intended to punish certain forms of private sexual relations
perceived as immoral. It has been misused to punish more serious cases of sexual violence
against women and children when the same ought to be dealt with as sexual offences within
the meaning of Section 375/376 IPC.
It is submitted that Article 15(3) of the Constitution allows for the State to make special
provision for women and children. Petition has also referred to the U.N. Right of Child
Convention ratified by the respondent No. 1 on 11th December, 1993.
The petition has submitted the following issues and legal propositions which require
consideration by the Court. They include whether rape should today be understood to include
not only forcible penile/vaginal penetration but all forms of forcible penetration including
non-consensual genital and oral penetration. Section 375 (penetration) provides for

punishment for rape under Section 376(2)(f) ""Whosever commits rape on a woman when she
is under twelve years of age"". The question is whether abuse of a child below the age of 12
should no longer be classified according to the 'type' of penetration.
Section 375 and 376 have been substantially changed by the Criminal Law (Amendment)
Act, 1983. Section 377 deals with unnatural offences and provides for a punishment as severe
as that provided for rape in Section 376. The punishment provided under Section 377 is
imprisonment for life or imprisonment of either description. Section 354 IPC provides for
punishment for assault or criminal force to woman to outrage her modesty. It is denied that
provisions of Sections 375, 376 and 377 are violative of fundamental rights under Articles 14,
15(3) and 21 of the Constitution of India.
Lawyer for the petitioner has submitted that Indian Penal Code has to be interpreted in the
light of the problems of present day. Learned counsel stressed that the words ""sexual
intercourse"" in Section 375 IPC should be interpreted to mean all kinds of sexual penetration
of any typeof any orifice of the body.
States Parties agree to ensure that the child has access to information and material from a
diversity of national and international sources, especially those aimed at the promotion of his
or her social, spiritual and moral well-being and physical and mental health. States Parties
also agree to encourage the development of appropriate guidelines for the protection of the
child from harm.
States Parties agree to take all appropriate measures to protect the child from all forms of
physical and mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or
exploitation including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any
other person.
An enactment of former days is to be read today, in the light of dynamic processing received
over the years. Learned counsel referred to passage of statutory interpretation by F.A.R.
Bennion (Buttterworths - 1984) at page 355-357. The words ""at or before or after the
marriage as consideration for the marriage"" occurring in Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition
Act were interpreted to mean demand of dowry at the ""negotiation stage"". The Court held that
it is a well known rule of interpretation of Statutes that the text and context of the entire Act
must be looked into.
Lawyer Ms. Meenakshi Arora argues that criminals should not go unpunished on mere
technicality of law. She cites House of Lords decisions to substantiate her contentions. A
husband and wife are to be regarded as equal partners in marriage, she argues. The words
""sexual intercourse"" occurring in Section 375 IPC must be given a larger meaning than as
traditionally understood. The Act of 1861 is a statute of the ""always speaking"" type. It must
be interpreted in light of scientific appreciation of the link between the body and psychiatric
injury.
Rape may amount to a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions, a violation of the laws or
customs of the war or an act of genocide, if the requisite elements are met, and may be
prosecuted accordingly. Under Article 5 of the Statute of the International Tribunal, rape is a
crime against humanity.

Shri R.N. Trivedi, learned Additional Solicitor General, appearing for the respondents, has
submitted that International Treaties ratified by India can be taken into account for framing
guidelines. Such matters are in the realm of State policy and are, therefore, not enforceable in
a Court of law.
Shri Trivedi has referred to Halsbury's Laws of England para 514 where unlawful sexual
intercourse with woman without her consent has been held to be an essential ingredient of
rape. Learned counsel has also referred to Dicey and Moris on The Conflict of Laws on the
enforcement of foreign law.
The cases involving penile penetration into vagina are covered under Section 375 of the IPC.
If acts such as penetration of finger or any inanimate object into vagina or anus are
committed against a woman or a female child, the provisions of proposed Section 354 IPC
can be invoked. A distinction has to be naturally maintained between sexual assault/use of
criminal force falling under Section 354 and unnatural offences. It may not be appropriate to
bring unnatural offences punishable under Section 377 IPC or mere sexual assault within the
ambit of Section 354 IPC.
The Indian Penal Code was drafted by the First Indian Law Commission of which Lord
Mecaulay was the President. It was presented to the Legislative Council in 1856 and passed
on October 6, 1860. The Penal Code has undergone very few changes in the last more than
140 years.
It is contrary to all rules of construction to read words into an Act unless it is absolutely
necessary to do so. It is wrong and dangerous to proceed by substituting some other words for
words of the statute. The fact that an enactment is a penal provision is in itself a reason for
ascribing extra meaning to phrases used in it.
Section 354, 375 and 377 IPC have come up for consideration before the superior courts of
the country. Prosecution of an accused for an offence under section 376 IPC on radically
enlarged meaning of section 375 IPC as suggested by the petitioner may violate the guarantee
enshrined in Article 20(1) of the Constitution.
In R. v. R. the husband forced his way into the house of his wife's parents and attempted to
have sexual intercourse with her against her will. In the course of doing so he assaulted her
by squeezing her neck with both hands. It is very doubtful whether the principle laid down
can be of universal application.
Indian Penal Code is part of the curriculum in the law degree and it is the existing definition
of ""rape"" which is taught to every student of law. An exercise to alter the definition of rape,
as contained in Section 375 IPC, by a process of judicial interpretation, is bound to result in
chaos and confusion.
The doctrine of stare decisis, meaning to stand by decided cases, rests upon the principle that
law by which men are governed should be fixed, definte and known. It is a wholesome
doctrine which gives certainty to law and guides the people to mould their affairs in future.
The doctrine of stare decisis is that a decision which has been followed for a long period of
time will generally be followed by courts of higher authority. The Supreme Appellate Court
will not shrink from overruling a decision, or series of decisions, which establish a doctrine
outside the statute. In Corpus Juris Secundum, a contemporary statement of American Law,

the doctrine of stare decisis is invoked. The basic feature of law is its certainty and in the
event of there being uncertainty as regards the state of law - the society would be in utter
confusion.
On July 26, 1966, the House of Lords made a department from its past practice. Their
lordships regard the use of precedent as an indispensible foundation. Too rigid adherence to
precedent may lead to injustice in a particular case and also restrict the proper development
of the law.
There is absolutely no doubt or confusion regarding the interpretation of provisions of
Section 375 IPC. The inquiry before the Courts relate only to the factual aspect of the matter.
It will not be in the larger interest of the State or the people to alter the definition of ""rape"".
The main suggestions made by the petitioner are for incorporating special provisions in child
sexual abuse cases to the following effect. They include allowing use of a videotaped
interview of a child's statement by the judge (in the presence of a court officer) and for cross
examination of a minor via closed circuit television or behind a screen.
The Law Commission suggested that a proviso can be placed above the Explanation to
section 273 of the Criminal Procedure Code to the following effect: ""Provided that where the
evidence of a person below 16 years is to be recorded, the Court may, take appropriate
measures to ensure that such person is not confronted by the accused"".
Section 715.1 of the Criminal Code was intended to preserve the evidence of the Child and to
remove the need for them to repeat their story many times. Benefits of such a provision
would have in limiting the strain imposed on child witness who are required to provide
detailed testimony about confusing, embarrassing and frightful incidents of abuse. The Court
noted that the rules of evidence have not been constitutionalised into unaltered principles of
fundamental justice. Neither should they be interpreted in a restrictive manner which may
defeat their purpose.
Section 273 Cr.C. lays down that any Criminal Court enquiring into or trying any offence
shall be deemed to be an open Court. It is rather surprising that the legislature while
incorporating sub-section (2) to Section 327 failed to take note of offences under Section 354
and 377 IPC.
Section 273 Cr.P.C. merely requires the evidence to be taken in the presence of the accused.
The Section, however, does not say that the evidence should be recorded in such a manner
that the accused should have full view of the victim or the witnesses.
A screen or some such arrangement can be made where the victim or witnesses do not have
to undergo the trauma of seeing the body or the face of the accused. Often the question put in
cross-examination are purposely designed to embarrass or confuse the victims of rape and
child abuse.
In State of Punjab v Gurmit Singh, [1996] 2 SCC 384 this Court had highlighted the
importance of provisions of Section 327(2) and (3) Cr.P.C. It was further directed that as far
as possible trial of such cases may be conducted by lady Judges.
Inquiry or trial offences under sections 354 and 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) will also
apply in cases of child sex abuse or rape. Questions put in cross-examination on behalf of the

accused, in so far as they relate directly to the incident, should be given in writing to the
President Officer of the Court.
We hope and trust that the Parliament will give serious attention to the points highlighted by
the petitioner and make appropriate legislation with all the promptness which it deserves. The
cases of child abuse and rape are increasing at alarming speed and appropriate legislation is,
therefore, urgently required, petitioners say.

We are concerned with the marketing of petrol and diesel, Superior Kerosene Oil (SKO), Light
Diesel Oil (LDO) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG). The challenge in these matters is to the
validity of the order of the Government of India dated 9th August, 2002.
In past also allotments of retail outlets for petroleum products were cancelled by this Court after
coming to the conclusion that the allotments made were arbitrary, on account of political
connections/motivation and extraneous considerations. The allotments which were on merits and
not tainted were not ordered to be cancelled.
From September 1977, a uniform procedure for selection of persons for appointment as
dealers/distributors applicable to all the public sector oil marketing companies was introduced by
the Government. The dealers were earlier selected from amongst the applicants by a selection
committee comprising senior officials of the oil companies.
will recommend a panel of maximum three names for a dealership/distributorship.
The DSBs, under the aforesaid guidelines, advertised 5641 locations out of which merit panels
were published for 3760 locations. Letters of intent (LOI) were issued to 3546 successful
applicants. The remaining LOI holders were in process of completing requisite formalities.
In view of the controversy regarding the allotments, the Prime Minister directed the Ministry of
Petroleum and Natural Gas to cancel all allotments made with effect from January 2000 till date.
The press release issued by Press Information Bureau and sent to the oil marketing companies
reads as under:""The Hon'ble Prime Minister today reviewed the allotment of Petrol Pump and
LPG Gas and Kerosene Agencies.
All allotments made on recommendations of Dealership Selection Boards which are headed by
retired Judges. All concerned petrol pumps and LPG and Kerosene agencies will be auctioned on
the basis of Competitive Bidding. However, allotments to families of Kargil Martyrs shall
remain unaffected.
All allotments made since January 2000 of Petrol Pumps, LPG distributorships and SKO LDO
dealerships of Public Sector Oil Companies to be cancelled. Issue was raised in the Parliament.
All allotments may be auctioned on the basis of Cancellation of petrol pumps, LPG
distributorships and kerosene dealerships made on the recommendations of DSBs since 1.1.2000
forthwith. Make alternate arrangements to that consumers are not put to any difficulties till the
appointment of new dealers/distributors. bidding.

The impugned order affects large number of dealers and distributors all over the country. A large
number (over 2300) intervention applications have been filed by different persons. Petition was
filed in High Courts of Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bombay and Gujarat.
We have heard learned counsel for the petitioners and interveners in support of their challenge to
the impugned order. The entire matter was triggered of as a result of media exposure on 2nd
August, 2002. The effect of the decision was on 3760 persons whose merit panels had been
published by the DSBs. The only reason for cancellation on 5th August was that a 'controversy'
had been raised. Between 6th and Learned counsel representing petitioners and interveners
submit that the en masse cancellation of allotments is clearly an arbitrary exercise of executive
power without any justification. The impugned order is contended to be wholly arbitrary and
unconstitutional being violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. August, Indian
Express carried the particulars of alleged tainted allottees numbering 104.
Learnt Solicitor General contends that, in fact, the course of action adopted by the Government is
worthy of commendation and calls for no intradiction. Counsel contends that all annulled retail
outlet dealerships, LPG distributorships and SKO-LDO dealerships will be auctioned. The
cancellation of the agreements is not for violation of any term thereof. The cancellation is on
account of a policy decision taken by the Government. There is no difference in respect of those
selectees who have been issued LOIs but are awaiting the execution of the agreement.
An order passed without application of mind deserves to be annulled as well as being an arbitrary
exercise of power. The decision in Bihar School Examination Board v Subhas Chandra Sinha &
Ors. has been This is not a case of any particular individual who is being charged with adoption
of unfair means. It was not necessary for the Board to give an opportunity to the candidates if the
examinations as a whole were being cancelled. The High Court interfered on the ground that
natural justice and fair-play were not observed. upon by learned Solicitor General for the
contention that allotments could en masse be legally cancelled.
The Court held that the examination was vitiated by practicing unfair means on a mass scale. The
Board could not be asked to hold a detailed enquiry into the matter to satisfy itself as to which of
the candidates had not adopted unfair means and the examination had to go ahead.
Indian Oil Corporation v. State of U.P. v. Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi & Ors. [1990] 3 SCC 752
was a case where the challenge of the appellant was to the action of the respondent, Indian Oil
Corporation in discontinuing the supply of all kinds of lubricants. In Shrilekha Vidyarthi's case,
this Court held that arbitrariness is writ large on the impugned circular. It was also noticed that
no common reason applicable to all of them justifying their termination in one stroke on a
reasonable ground had been shown.
The roll model for governance and decision taken by the Government should manifest equity,
fair play and justice. The Government has to rise above the nexus of vested interests and
nepotism. The act of governance has to withstand the test of judiciousness and impartiality.
Reliance has been placed by learned counsel to the allegations made in para 2.3 of Transfer Case
No.90 of 2002. The petition contends that the entire exercise of cancellation was a result of the
name of the Prime Minister's relative being involved on account of which the PM ordered en
masse cancellation.

Our attention was also drawn by learned counsel to only reply to the averment which is to the
following effect:-""With reference to para 2.3.1, it is submitted that the contents therein are the
excerpts quoted from various newspapers and hence need no reply.
In respect of 360 complaints made against the Chairmen/Members of the DSBs, inquiries were
conducted by Director General, Anti Adulteration Cell and out of which 242 cases were
recommended to be closed. This means no substance were found in 242 complaints out of 360;
39 cases were sub-judice. The controversy raised was in respect of 5 to 10%, as earlier indicated.
In such a situation, en masse cancellation would be unjustified and arbitrary.
It seems that the impugned order was a result of panic reaction of the Government. No facts and
figures were provided by the Solicitor General.",,Onkar Lal Bajaj Etc Etc vs Union Of India _ Anr Etc Etc on 20 December 2002,"[-0.37950358  0.32425734  0.01706229 -0.56845915 -0.3140597   0.14592996

",1,1,,"(Judgment of the Court delivered by PRABHA SRIDEVAN, J.) Little Mohanapriya, aged
three, died not for any fault of hers, but because she was a hindrance to the amorous activities
of the appellants - the child's mother and her paramour. The appellants have preferred this
appeal against the conviction and sentence awarded by the learned Additional District and
Sessions Judge, Kumbakonam in 2002. The appellants have preferred this appeal against the
conviction and sentence awarded by the learned Additional District and Sessions Judge,
Kumbakonam in Sessions Case No.146 of 2002 dated 28.2.2003 finding A-1 guilty of the
offence punishable under Section 302 r/w 34 I.P.C. for which he was sentenced to undergo
rigorous imprisonment for life and pay a fine of Rs.1 lakh and on failure to pay the fine
amount, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a further period of 12 years and also finding
him guilty under Section 201 I.P.C. for which he was sentenced to undergo rigorous
imprisonment for three years and finding A-2 guilty of the offence punishable under Section
302 r/w 34 I.P.C. for which she was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life and
pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- and on failure to pay the fine amount, to undergo rigorous
imprisonment for a further period of 2 years and also finding her guilty under Section 201
I.P.C. for which she was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 3 years.
This is how the prosecution has established the chain of evidence. According to nurse PW.6,
the deceased was taken away from the hospital without being discharged. Accused 1 and 2
are nurses and the male nurse in the hospital. A-1 and A-2 felt that the presence of the
deceased was a hindrance to their illicit affair. PW.6, PW.8 and PW.9 are nurses and the male
nurse in the hospital, who also speak of the presence of Accused 1 and 2 in the hospital. A-1,
A-2 and the deceased child lived together in the house belonging to PW.18.
Village Administrative Officer of Theperumanallur Village received a message at 6.00 a.m
on 15.05.2001 that a child was lying dead on the road. Immediately, he and the Village
Assistant P.W.2 went to the scene of occurrence. When the bag was opened, they found the
body of a child about three years old. On the basis of the complaint, the Sub-Inspector of
Police, PW.20, registered a case of suspicious death. He sent the Express F.I.R., Ex.P.30 to
the Magistrate and the higher authorities. The post-mortem doctor conducted the autopsy on
the dead body of the child at Thiruvidaimaruthur Government Hospital. At about 8.30 a.m, he
went to Thiruvidaimaruthur Police Station and lodged the complaint, Ex.P.1 with PW.20, the
Sub-Inspector of Police. At about 8.00 a.m, he went to his Taluk Office and sent one
Kaliyamoorthy to remain with P.W.2 at the scene of occurrence.
PM No.9/2001. The body was first seen by the undersigned at 3.00 p.m on 15.05.2001. Its
condition then was Rigor Mortis present in all the four limbs. Multiple (NC) scorches of
varying sizes present all over the body. 1)Report of blood samples, received from
N.Gunachandran Assistant Chemical Examiner to Government, Assistant Director - Serology

- Chennai. The Assistant Director and Assistant Chemical Examiner to Government Regional
Forensic Science Lab - Thanjavur. The Postmortem Report is Ex.P.8.
Inspector of Nadukkaveri Police Station PW.17 came to the office of the post-mortem doctor
on 17.05.2001 and informed him that the child whose photograph was published in the
newspapers is his child. He searched for the accused in other places, he arranged for notices
to be published in newspapers and information given in Television. In the mean time, PW.27
found the Ambassador car, in connection with Crime No.101 of 2001 Thiruvaiyaru By-Pass
Road from Tanjore to Kumbakonam. When he saw the police, A-1 stopped the car and
attempted to run away. It was driven by A-1 and A-2 was sitting in the rear seat. PW.27
admitted A-1 in the Tanjore Medical College Hospital for treatment of his injured leg and
remanded A-2 to judicial custody. Admissible portion of the confession statement is Ex.P.24.
The case of suspicious death was altered into one under Section 302 and 201 I.C.R. PW.28
took charge of the investigation and recorded the statements of witnesses at the Kumbakonam
Government Hospital.
The learned counsel for the first appellant adopted the arguments. According to him, the
entire case is based on circumstantial evidence and none of the links are complete. The father
of A-1 had paid the rental advance and it is extremely doubtful if a father will assist his son in
illicit affairs. Under Section 313 Cr.P.C., they denied each and every circumstance put up
against them and stated that they have been falsely implicated in this case. 9. The evidence of
PW.3 and PW.10 cannot be believed since they have failed to identify A-1 in the test
identification parade so their entire evidence has to be eschewed.
Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the evidence of PW.6 and PW.8, nurses and
the male nurse is also not reliable. At best, their evidence would only show that A-2 was in
the hospital with the deceased and nothing would turn on that since A-1 had fought with the
auto drivers group and therefore, PW.11 is an inimical witness.
Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the evidence of PW.13 is really irrelevant
and apart from stating that A-1 picked up polythene bag, there is nothing in his evidence to
link the accused with the occurrence. Most importantly, the case of the prosecution is that the
accused were found in the Ambassador Car which was connected with the Crime No.110 of
2001 at Nadukkaveri Police Station. Therefore, the arrest and recovery are extremely suspect
and no reliance can be placed on them. 14. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that
the evidence of PW.13 is really irrelevant and apart from stating that A-1 picked up polythene
bag, there is nothing in his evidence to link the accused with the occurrence.
2005 (1) L.W.C. (Crl.) 161 (Sasikumar vs. State rep. By Inspector of Police,
Karungalpalayam Police Station, Erode District). This was a case of circumstantial evidence,
wherein a Division Bench of this Court held that the prosecution had to establish all the
circumstances which will form a complete chain pointing to the guilt of the accused. 2004
S.C.C. (Crl.) 126 (State of Haryana vs. Jagbir Singh and Another)
The Supreme Court has rejected the evidence of a witness who could not remember the
particulars of the dress worn by the accused in the case of Kojja Sreenu vs. State of Madya
Pradesh vs. Ghudan, 2005 S.C. (Crl.) 853.
The learned counsel for the appellants submitted that whichever view is favourable to the
accused should be accepted. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that the

prosecution has proved its case beyond any reasonable doubt. She said A-1, A-2 and the
deceased were together as a family before the occurrence. 19. The learned Additional Public
Prosecutor submitted that even if one were to eschew the evidence of PW.3, the witness who
was in the hospital and who claims to have seen the accused with the deceased and the
evidence of PW.10, the auto driver who claims to have last seen the accused with the
deceased, because they failed to identify A-1 at the test identification parade, there are
enough materials to show the involvement of the accused in the act.
The learned Additional Public Prosecutor referred to the evidence of PW.6, a nurse who has
deposed that on 14.5.2001 a.m. the plaster cast should be removed and on the next day both
the child and A-2 were not present. There was nothing in the cross-examination of. PW.7 to
doubt the presence of her in the hospital and therefore, the non-production of any evidence to
show that she was admitted as inpatient is really not fatal to the prosecution case. The male
nurse attendant who removed the plaster put from the deceased had also identified A-1 as the
person who was with the deceased at the time.
The learned Additional Public Prosecutor pointed to the crucial evidence of PW.27 who was
the Inspector of Police of Nadukkaveri Police Station and who had arrested A-1 and A-2 in
the Ambassador Car in connection with the Crime No.110/2001. PW.26 is another
independent witness who had gone to the Thanjavur Medical College and Hospital with his
employer Ananda Raj.
We have perused the entire materials available on record and we will now examine the oral
evidence let in by the prosecution. P.W.3:. He is a tailor who was admitted as inpatient in the
Kumbakonam Government Hospital. According to his evidence, the deceased was admitted
in the same ward for injury on her left hand.
On 30.04.2001, at about 11'o clock, a nurse working in the Kumbakonam Government
Hospital gave A-2 some medicine that has to be given to the deceased thrice during the day.
The doctor came for his rounds and said that the plaster cast could be removed that day and
thereafter it would be possible to give the child a bath. P.W.4 is an agricultural coolie whose
son was injured when the roof of his house fell down due to the storm. To take care of her,
A.2, her mother was present. On 1'o clock, since her duty was over, P.W.6 went home.
Nursing assistant in the Kumbakonam Government Hospital, P.W.7: She was an inpatient in
the same ward as A-1 and A-2 when the deceased had a severe fracture on her left leg. When
no one was present, he would throw the deceased; when the mother was there, he played with
the deceased. She gave information to the doctors and also gave a police intimation. The next
morning at 7'o clock, when she joined duty, she found that the dead were missing.
A-1 is a cycle shop owner in Kumabakonam and he gave his cycles on hire. He is also an
auto driver and has seen A-1 and A-2 parked his auto in front of the Kumbakongonam
Government Hospital. On 14.05.2001, he was standing near the Electricity Board Office,
since there was no petrol in the auto, when he saw them pass passed him in the cycle. P.W.12
has seen the accused with the deceased before the fateful hour. He had also parked his auto in
front of the Kumbakonam Government Hospital. On 14.05.2001, he was standing near the
Kumbakonam Electricity Board Office, since there was no petrol in the auto. P.W.13: He is
also an Auto driver. He has seen A-1 and A-2.

Judicial Magistrate Papanasam Puliancheri PW.3 and PW.10 failed to identify A-1 in the test
identification parade. We shall now see if the prosecution has established its case even if the
evidence is eschewed. The first link is the evidence of PW.18.
The next link is PW.6. A-2, the mother of the deceased child, speaks of A-2 admitting the
deceased for treatment. The next witness is A-1, the Doctor, who has admitted the deceased
on 28.4.2001 with injuries which are alleged to have been sustained by her when she fell
down from the stairs. This witness establishes the next link in the chain. Ex.P.9 is the
Accident Register. Therefore, this witness speaks of A-2 admitting the deceased for
treatment. A-1 was flinging and throwing the deceased on the bed when A-2 was not present.
This is unusual behaviour and therefore, PW.7, who was in the same ward, noticed this. She
had spoken of how A-1 would treat the child when no one was present. Non-production of
the admission slip of PW.7 is really not fatal to the prosecution case.
PW.8 is a nurse who had spoken about the child being taken away without being duly
discharged. PW.11 is an auto driver standing near the Kumbakonam E.D. Office since his
vehicle had run out of petrol. A-1 was driving the cycle and A-2 was sitting having the
deceased child on her lap, they passed by him and went away. The cycle shop owner is the
next important link to prove that the accused were last seen with the deceased. No doubt, it
was contended on behalf of the appellant that the cycle has not been recovered.
40. The final link is the evidence of PW.27 who had confronted that the two accused on
19.5.2001 at 5.00 p.m. came in the Ambassador Car PY-01/P-2235 before their arrest. The
prosecution has clearly established every link of the chain of circumstantial evidence. A-1
and A-2 were found together in the Ambassador Car PY-01/P-2235 Jambu Kaveri Channel.
The arrest of both the accused together is another link. The recovery witness, PW.26, also
cannot be rejected since he went along with his employer Ananda Raj.
Supreme Court of India: Joseph vs. State of Kerala was a case of circumstantial evidence in
which incriminating circumstances were such as to lead only to a hypothesis of guilt and
exclude every possibility of innocence of the accused. Supreme Court found fact of the
deceased being taken away from the Convent by the appellant as a formidable incriminating
circumstance against the appellant. The Supreme Court held that the appellant failed to
explain or clarify the incriminating circumstances inculpating him, and connecting him with
the crime. During the time of questioning under Section 313 CrPC, the appellant instead of
making at least an attempt to explain or clarify the incriminating circumstances inculpating
him, and connecting him with the crime by his adamant attitude of total denial of everything
when those circumstances were brought to his notice by the Court not only lost the
opportunity but stood self-condemned.
Ex.P.8, the Postmortem Certificate, shows injuries, which includes broken bones, multiple
scratches all over the body, multiple abrasions, burns and a broken hip joint. Mohanapriya
suffered every possible act of violence before she breathed her last. Though the genital
organs did not contain semen, the postmortem doctor had stated that the child's genital organs
were swollen. There is very little awareness in our country about child abuse.
The National Child Abuse Study was undertaken by Prayas Institute of Juvenile Justice, Goa.
The report is based on the National Charter for Children and the National and State
Commission(s) on the Rights of Child. No authentic data or report on child abuse is available
to formulate a national level legislation and a national policy. ii) Need for a Study on Child

Abuse - The National Study on Child Abuse has been taken up primarily to assess the
situation of child abuse, in the light of the National Charter for Children and the National and
State Commission(s) on the Rights of Child, likely to be enacted by the Parliament soon.
Child abuse is not viewed as a separate offence or group of offences, causing physical and
emotional damage to the child. It is, at best, viewed in the context of child labour, child
prostitution and child trafficking, for which legal provisions have been made. The extent of
abuse inflicted on children gets reflected from the crime records data.
In his book, The Evidence in Child Abuse and Neglect Cases, John E.B. Myers has observed
that head injury is one of the most deadly forms of non-accidental injury. The deceased died
of homicidal violence and this is clear from the above literature, which focusses on child
abuse. Levitt, Smith and Alexander: ""Abusive head trauma is the most common cause of
death from child abuse"".
Sir Alfred Wills' Circumstantial Evidence: If there be any reasonable doubt of the guilt of the
accused, he is entitled as of right to be acquitted. Satish Padala Veera Reddy v State of A.P.,
1989 Supp (2) S.C. 706 was published in 2005.
The learned counsel for both the appellants submitted, without prejudice, that the award of
fine of Rs.1 lakh and 12 years' rigorous imprisonment for failure to pay the same on the first
appellant amounts almost to awarding two sentences for life. Considering the above
circumstances, the judgment of the Additional District and Sessions Judge-cum-Chief
Judicial Magistrate, Thanjavur at Kumbakonam has been set aside. Considering the above
circumstances and since we have found the appellants guilty of the offences punishable under
Section 302 read with Section 34 I.P.C. and since we are not inclined to set aside the sentence
of award of rigorous imprisonment for life, the judgment of the Additional District and
Sessions Judge-cum-Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thanjavur at Kumbakonam dated 28.2.2003
made in Sessions Case No.146 of 2002 with regard to imposition of fine of a sum of Rs.1
lakh on the first appellant and a fine of Rs.5,000/- on the second appellant alone is set aside.
Mr. V.M. Neesh, the learned counsel appointed as Amicus Curiae, who represented the
second accused, is entitled to get the counsel's fee from the Legal Services Authority. The
Accident Register, Ex.P.9 shows that the deceased child has suffered an injury, which was
explained as a result of a fall from the stairs.",,Palanivel vs State Inspector Of Police on 18 December 2006,"[ 0.36675957  0.30535862 -0.42806086 -0.6349574  -0.3332927  -0.38049895

",1,1,,"This judgment will govern miscellaneous Civil Case No. 63 of 1944 and Miscellaneous Civil
Cases Nos. 7, 8, 85, 91, 92 and 98 of 1945. These cases are all income-tax references made
under Section 66 (1) of the Income-tax Act, as amended in 1939. This is clear from the Act,
but the matter has been placed beyond controversy by their Lordships of the Privy Council in
Commissioner of Income-tax, Bihar & Orissa v. Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga
The question which concerns all the cases has been referred in these terms in Miscellaneous
Civil Case No. 63 of 1944:-""Whether, in the circumstances of this case, the income of Rs.
10,835 derived from the sale of forest produce is agricultural income exempt from taxation?"".
It is land which is (1) used for agricultural purposes and (2) either assessed to land revenue in
British India or subject to a local rate assessed and collected by officers of the Crown as such.
The Oxford English Dictionary defines agriculture as the ""art or science of cultivating the
ground"". Webster defines it as ""the art of farming or cultivating forests"". The essence of
agriculture, even when it is extended to include ""forestry"", is the application of human skill
and labour. And that we feel must be the determining factor in this class of case. Turning next
to the cases, one of the most importants is the Federal court judgment in Meghraj v. Allah
Rakhia not because it deals directly with this question, though it touches an allied matter, but
because it lays down certain general principles which bind us, and clears much of the ground.
The English language must be understood ""in the sense which it ordinarily bears in the
English language"", the Learned Judges of the Court of Appeal have said. The learned Judges
were dealing with the expression ""agricultural land"" in the Constitution Act, and after
pointing out that it had not been defined there said: ""It is neither useful nor legitimate to
attempt to draw any inference from these statutory definitions"". Some of the cases discussed
in the Federal Courts judgment at pages 62-65 relate to special Acts such as Province of
Bihar v. Pratap Udai Nath Sahi Deo and Chandrasekhara Bharathi v. Duraisami Naidu, Kesho
Prasad v. Sheo Pargash Ojha and Hiralal Ravchand v. Parbhulal Sakhidas.
As to the other cases, the Federal Court state that the view taken in Murugesa Chetti v.
Chinna Thambi Goundan, Venkayya v. Ramasami and Panadai Pathan v. Ramasami Chetty
has not gone unchallenged and the learned judges refer to Chandrasekhara Bharathi v.
Duraisami Naidu. Chandrasekhara Bharatiya Bharathi v. Duraisami Naidu, Murugesa Chetti
v. Chinna Thambi Goundan and Panadai Pathan v. Ramasami Chetty are among the cases
referred to by the Federal Court in Meghraj v Allah Rakhia. The decisions referred to are
Kaju Mal v. Saligram. and Kaju Mal v. Saligram.
Emperor v. Probhat Chandra held that income derived from pasturage was agricultural
income but not that from fisheries or land leased for stacking timber. The ""pasturage"" part of
the decision would, at first sight, appear to offend the rule we have suggested. That apart,
nearly every rule has its exceptions. Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras v. Manavedan
Tirumalpad holds that income from unassessed forest land is not agricultural income and

unassessed forest land is not agricultural income and Province of Bihar v. Pratap Udai Nath
Sahi Deo applies the same rule to uncultivated forest land, as also does Maharaja of
Kapurthala v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Central and United Provinces, Special Manager,
Court of Wards v. Commissioner of Income-tax, U. P. & C. P. Mustafa Ali Khan v.
Commissioner of Income-tax, U. P. & C. P. and Nawazish Ali Khan v. Mustafa Ali Khan v.
Commissioner of Income-tax, U. P. & C. P. The other cases dealt with other matters, such as
dairy farming and allowances from a zemindari to a Rani.
But we think it is sufficiently met in Maharaja of Kapurthala v. Commissioner of Income-tax,
Central and United Provinces. This view will be found advanced in, for instance Chief
Commissioner of Income-tax v. Zamindar of Singampatti. So also Section 10 sets out what is
to constitute ""profits and gains of business, profession or vocation.""
The Lords of the Privy Council have ruled that section 6 of the Income Tax Act, which
includes sections 4 (3) (viii) and 2 (1) (a) and (b) would be otiose of agricultural income is
exempt in any way. In Prabhatchandra Barua v. Emperor at page 442 their Lordships say that
the words appear to be ""clear and emphatic, and expressly framed"".
The Privy Council in Srimathoo Moothoo Vijia Ragoonadah Kolandapuree Netchiar v.
Dorasinga Tevar is quoted as saying: ""No inconsistent course of practice should be allowed
to spring up in any of the presidencies"". The case is not in point but the observations are
pertinent. Another branch of this argument had relation to a possible conflict between the
Provincial and Federal Legislative Lists in the Constitution Act unless the matter was decided
by the assessees. This is a variation of an argument made by Gwyer, C.J., in Hindu Womens
Rights to Property Act, 1937, In Re Gwyer v. Attorney-General of Canada. It is true this was
not done in the course of a judgment but was an interjection during the arguments, but the
substance of what he said accords with what the Privy Council laid in H. M. Edward v.
Attorney-General of Canada. The other phase of this argument was only a variation of what
was argued before the Federal Court in Hulas Narain Singh v. Province of Bihar.
Mr Mangalmurti argued that the term ""agriculture"" should be understood to include income
derived from by-professes, such as the selling of milk, the pasturing of cattle etc., provided
the endeavour is agricultural. The distinction may be of importance in some cases, but here it
still leaves the burden on the court to decide what agriculture means. An attempt was made to
get us to take into consideration the previous practice of the department and the instructions
embodied in the Income-tax Manual. This also is not permissible. The Courts are here to
interpret the law and what departmental officers thought is not relevant. We do not think it
will be proper to take those matters into consideration and so will exclude them.
Hiria v Hiria v. Mohamed Sirajuddin Khan. Priyawati Devi Income-tax Appellate Tribunal
No. 63 of 1944 -. The facts were agreed in this case. It appears from the order of reference
that the forest here was not a cultivated one and was of spontaneous growth. According to our
definition, they are not included within the exemption and so are liable to tax. But the
decision was based on the C. P. Tenancy Act which extended the definition of agriculture.
The forest income is derived from a sale of timber which the assessee cuts into beams, logs,
poles etc.; also from the sale of tendu leaves used in the manufacture of bidis. The finding
regarding the nature of the forest is to be to found in the Tribunals appellate order and is
given in these words:-""It is impossible that all these forest trees or tendu shrubs could have

been planted or reared by any process of agriculture"". The Appellate Assistant Commissioner
found that the forest was of spontaneous growth and that ""nothing is done in the nature of
preparing land for the growth of the trees therein"". The forest income here was derived from
leases of the forest ""for the purpose of cutting and removing standing timber and fuel, and
taking tendu leaves, lac and harra therefrom.""
Miscellaneous Civil Case No. 85 of 1945. The income in both these cases was from the sale
of forest trees. The Tribunal finds that the forest was of spontaneous growth and that ""nothing
is done in the nature of preparing land for the growth of the trees therein"". No process of
agriculture was employed in growing the forest, the Tribunal finds. Miscellaneous Civil case
No. 91 of 1945.

Division Bench of this Court in Pratapapmal Laxmichand, Firm v. Commissioner of Income-
tax, U. P, C. P., & Berar. ""Whether the sum of (Rs. 1,270) representing interest received by

the assessee on the arrears of agricultural rents due to him from his tenants is agricultural
income within the meaning of section 2 (1) (a) of the Income-Tax Act?"". This matter has
been recently decided by a Division Bench of this Court in Pratapmal Laxmichand, Firm v.
Commissioner of Income-tax, U. P, C. P., & Berar. Division Bench of Pratapmal
Laxmichand Firm v. Commissioner of Income-tax, U.P., C. P., and Berar: We find that the
matter is debatable and that it is as easy for a Judge acting judicially to reach the one
conclusion as the other.
The Tribunal has rejected Mangalmurti's claim that the bazar dues and nazrana receipts of Rs.
171 and Rs. 192 respectively were items of agricultural income. The point was ""abandoned
before us by council for the assessee"" on the second day, the Tribunal said.
Assessees in Miscellaneous Civil Case No. 63 of 1944 and Miscellaneous Civil Cases Nos. 8
and 85 of 1945 will have to pay the Commissioners costs of the Commissioner in all but
these three cases. Counsels fee Rs. 100 in each case. The success of the assessee on this point
in two of the cases is so negligible as compared with his failure that we think it proper that
each should pay the commissioners costs there as well. That leaves Miscellaneous Civil Case
No. 85 of 1945.

She sent a representation to the Government of India, the first respondent herein, on 23.08.2004. Since she felt that the action on representation may take some time and if such time is allowed the film would be continued to be screened thereby causing imminent danger to the public morality, she has rushed to this Court and filed this Writ Petition. As the certificate for public exhibition had been issued in gross violation of the provisions of the Cinematograph Act,1952 , she sent a representation to the Government of India, the first respondent herein, on 23.08.2004, bringing to its notice about the violations, requesting to revoke the certificate, by invoking the revisional powers under Section 6 of the Cinematograph Act. 3. The main prayer in this Writ Petition is for issuance of a writ of mandamus, directing the Government of India, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, New Delhi, first respondent herein, and the Central Board of Film Certification, Sastri Bhavan, Chennai, second respondent herein, to revoke the Censor Certificate for public exhibition, issued to the Tamil Feature Film ""New"", produced by S.Annai Mari Madha Creations, the third respondent herein. Mr.V.Ramasubramanian, learned counsel for the petitioner, seeks for a mandamus for revocation of the Censor Certificate issued to the film. Under Section 5 B(1) of the Cinematograph Act,1952, a film shall not be certified for public exhibition by the competent authority, if the film or any part of it is against public order, decency or morality.(c) Under Section 5 B (2) of the Act, the Government of India issued some guidelines for ensuring the Board of Film Certification to find out the fitness for issuance of the said certificate. Under Section 5 B (2) of the Act, the Board of Film Certification shall ensure that the scenes depicting child abuse, vulgarity, obscenity or depravity and the dialogues catering to the baser instincts, are not allowed in the film. Mr.S.Manikumar, learned Central Government Standing Counsel, would submit the following, by way of reply:. ""The Writ Petition is not maintainable, especially when a representation dated 23.08.2004 has been sent by the petitioner to the first respondent and since the scenes and the dialogues in the film go with the story-line, the second respondent issued Censor Certificate with restricted exhibition by giving 'A' Certificate, after suggesting for deletions of some portions of the film, and, accordingly, the suggested cuts have been implemented in total compliance of the orders of the authority and the intention of making a film is to entertain the masses and, therefore, the third respondent's right to freedom of expression through the film cannot be stifled.""(1) Whether the film ""New"", which is in question, is produced in accordance with the guidelines issued under Section 5 B of the Cinematograph Act,1952 ? ;(2) whether the Censor Certificate, issued by the second respondent/Central Board of Film Certification, is in consonance with the provisions of the Act ? The Central Government constituted a Board for examination and certification of films, for public exhibition, which consists of the Chairman and other members. Under Section 5-B(1), a film shall not be certified for public exhibition if, in the opinion of the competent authority to grant the certificate, the film or any part of it is against the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality or involves defamation or contempt of court or is likely to incite the commission of any offence. For the purpose of examination of films, for public exhibition, the Central Government constituted a Board called as Board of Film Certification, which consists of Chairman and other members.Although freedom is a constitutional right falling under Article 19 (1) of the Constitution of India, which says that all persons shall have freedom of speech and expression, this right is subject to reasonable restrictions on the grounds set out in Article 19 (2) of the Constitution. The Central Government of India has issued directions to the Board of Film Censors, while granting the Censor Certificate. The objectives of film certification will be to ensure that the medium of film remains responsible and sensitive to the values and standards of society. Article 19 (1) of the Constitution of India states that all persons shall have freedom of speech and expression. The Government of India has issued a set of guidelines for the Board of Film Certification (CBFC) of India, which include that: (i) The medium of film should remain responsible and sensitive to the moral values and standards of society, giving a clean and healthy environment and, at any cost, ensuring that human sensibilities are not offended by obscenity or depravity.In that city, two scientists, namely, Alwa Odison and Sir CV were living. When they transformed him, the transformation test did not succeed fully and he became the boy only in the day time. During night hours, he behaves as the husband of Priya's sister. It is contended that the film offends human sensibilities by its vulgarity and sexual perversions. It is also claimed that the public order, decency and morality are emphasised in Section 5-B(1) of the Indian Cinematograph (Public Order) Ordinance.Section 5-B(2) of the Supreme Court's ruling on film obscenity: The standard to be applied by the Board or Courts for judging the film should be that of an ordinary man of common sense and prudence and not that of a hypersensitive manner. This is in stark contrast to the purport of the guidelines issued by the Central Government under Section 5-C(2). We looked at every scene in the film to find out whether there is any child abuse or obscenity with dual meaning dialogues, catering to the baser instincts of the viewers. In the Annexure 'A', the petitioner has given 29 sequences with details of the dialogues. Let us now deal with the selected scenes out of those sequences.According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, the film was made in order to make the audience imagine about some other part of the body, thereby portraying vulgarity and catering to the baser instincts of the audience. The learned counsel says that the instruments used in every field are made as small; dwarf trees, bonsai etc. have been discovered by scientists and does not convey any other meaning. (c) This reply is not convincing, especially in the absence of any explanation as to why the scientist and his friend remarked, saying "" we know what you want to make big ?"", with peculiar smile. There is no explanation by the learned counsel for the third respondent as to why the heroine asks the hero to become like an eight legged insect and walk through her body and to go below and below and still more below on the body, which would convey the thing of obscenity to the viewers. The song spiderman contains the following words:vl;Lf; fhy; g{r;rp nghy; clk;gpy;CWfpwhd;/,d;Dk; bfh"";rk; fPnH. Hence, it is to be taken that the song has been written purposely to exhibit vulgarity.The next sequence is the conversation between the heroine and her lady friend. To show this scene, the camera is placed in a particular position to show the heroine from the angle of the two exposed legs. There is no reason as to why the girl friend, who is close to the heroine, should be shown as a cigarette smoking girl. The message given to the lady audience is quite dangerous, the learned counsel for the petitioner says. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, the entire sequence where the heroine attempts to seduce the hero by removing her saree from the upper portion of the body is nothing but a vulgar display of sexual perversion. Hero looks at the breast and finds a whistle, which is tied with a rope around the neck of the heroine. In the next scene, the heroine, by her gesture, tempts the hero, as per the advice of the smoking girl friend.In the movie, a boy of eight years is shown looking at his mother's breast while she is sitting in an auto-rickshaw, and raising his eyebrows in exclamation. The dialogues made by the hero would clearly indicate that he wanted to have intercourse with the heroine at least once, saying that he could not control, as he had seen the breast portion of the body. This reply is totally unacceptable, in view of the fact that the dialogues are admittedly dual meaning dialogues. A boy of eight years, who had sexual connection with the heroine during night hours, had shown the adult feeling by giving a look at the close up breast portion. Could it be said that this scene is in line with the theme of the story ? We have to emphatically say ""Not at all"".In this sequence, the hero returns from his office and the heroine gives a sexual and romantic look. Next, the heroine invites the hero for sexual intercourse, by saying ""cg;g[K:l;il J}f;fyhk; th "" (let us lift the salt bag, come). The next sequence is the conversation between the scientist and the hero. What is the message conveyed through this scene to the audience, that too women? Next scene is the conversation between the doctor and the hero. The hero explains to the doctor as to how he used to have sexual intercourse with his wife, by placing his palm of one hand over the other and telling him how he had intercourse with her on the bed. The doctor remarks "" gny iffhhpah,Ug;gh nghypUf;nf"" (She seems to be a very talented woman!). This shows the doctor remarking that she was a superwoman, who overpowered him. The message conveyed to audience through this scene is not in good taste. When the doctor shows similar display, by placing the upper hand over the other to hero, the hero swiftly corrects and explains to the doctor, saying, the upper hand is heroine and that he was lying on the bed and the heroine was lying on him.The conversation between the hero and the second heroine is full of dual meaning dialogues, conveying vulgarity and obscenity. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, this is nothing short of vulgarity. It is pointed out that the scene has been purposely picturised to make the audience enjoy the dual meaning vulgar dialogues. The most vulgar and obscene scenes in the film have been introduced under the guise of introducing a character of 20 year old girl, second heroine, who is the wife of a sixty-year-old man. The scenes and the conversation between them at that time are shown as if they indulged in sexual intercourse.Idhaya Kani, Mundhanai Mudichu and Sakala Kala Vallavan have all been censored. The film ""New"" contains a scene in which the child of eight years walks from this side to that side inside the hospital with an anxious mood to know whether there will be a safe delivery by the heroine, his wife. This is nothing but child abuse. It is contended that in celebrity temples, there are sculptures depicting the essence of kamasutra and in the context of globalisation, the very concept of censorship is increasingly becoming meaningless. The above submission by the learned counsel for the respondents, in comparison with foreign films, that all the scenes in this film are in line with the theme of the film and they are not vulgar at all cannot be accepted.It is the duty of the Court to consider in each case whether a particular motion picture is obscene or not. The films should be of educative value and then only they can play an important role in subverting the interests of the society, says the Supreme Court. It is the particular film that needs certification alone has to be viewed and if it is found to be in conformity with law, then alone, it is entitled to a certification under Section 5-A. Cinema or a motion picture with lascivious pornographic sceneries is not a free licence to a producer of a motion film with a view to exhibit dirt for money's sake or to exploit people's weaknesses as a commercial venture to make money.If the above observations, giving the legal parameters that are to be taken into consideration for issuance of certificate outlined by the Supreme Court, are applied to the film in question, there is no difficulty for this Court to conclude that the theme, scenes, sequences and songs, depicting child abuse, vulgarity, obscenity and dialogues giving dual meaning, catering to the baser instincts of the public, which have been picturised purposely for arousing the sensual feelings of the public, especially the young, in the film ""New"" would violate the statutory provisions and guidelines and, as such, it has to be held that the film ""New"" has not been produced in accordance with the guidelines under the Cinematograph Act and that the Censor Certificate has been issued to this film by the Board with folded hands and blind eyes and, hence, the same is liable to be revoked. The Tamil Nadu (Compulsory Censorship of Film Publicity Materials) Act 25 of 1987 should be applied to the film ""New"". 41. Before concluding, this Court is constrained to deal with one another contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner, bringing to the notice of this Court some painful and startling features, which are as under:""(i) The first team of members of the Censor Board, which viewed the film at the beginning, did not approve the film for certification. Mr.Surya, the Producer, violated the provisions of the Cinematograph Act,1952, by exhibiting in the theatre ""Mayajal"", as though the film was certified as U/A, thereby violating the conditions for grant of 'A' Certificate. The State Government has not taken any action to stop the same, by virtue of the powers conferred in The Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act.It is admitted in the counter affidavit that a private detective agency was appointed by the Central Board of Film Certification Headquarters for detecting the violations of the provisions of the Cinematograph Act. According to the Censor Board, though the implementing authority of the Act is the State Government, the police and the other authorities have not shown any interest in the implementation of the said Act. It is further admitted that the adult oriented scenes and songs are not to be telecast in TV Channels, in view of The Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, but, in this case, the television channels telecast the same liberally. Under The Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, there is a prohibition for transmitting the adult films from 6.00 AM to 11.00 PM. As it was found that the same was not followed by the Censor Board/second respondent, the records were produced for our perusal. ""New"" publicity materials like posters, newspaper advertisements, video clippings, photographs etc. can be screened only after getting clearance from the State Government under the Tamil Nadu (Compulsory Censorship of Film Publicity Materials) Act 25 of 1987. But without getting clearance, the same were published. A memorandum was submitted to the Censor Board to review the matter and to take action against the Producer. A complaint was also lodged with the police. The Central Board of Film Certification appointed a private detective agency to check up with the theatres, in which the film ""New"" is screened, whether the uncensored obscene scenes are screened and whether the publicity materials, which are prohibited, have been published through the advertisements.CBFC, Mumbai issued an order, directing the Regional Office at Chennai to enquire Mr. Surya, the Producer, by issuing necessary notice. On that basis, he was summoned to come and appear before the Board at Chennai on 12.08.2004. When it was brought to the notice that he carried out only one cut among the 18 cuts suggested, Mr.Surya compelled both Mr.A. Dhanasekaran, Assistant Regional Officer and Mrs.Vanathi Srinivasan, lady member of the Advisory Panel Board, to talk to the Officer at Central Board of Film Certification, Mumbai, immediately, in his presence over cell phone. An F.I.R. was registered in Crime No.1462 of 2004 on the file of F-3 Nungambakkam Police Station, Chennai. Then, an F.I.R. was registered in Crime No.1462 of 2004 on the file of F-3 Nungambakkam Police Station, Chennai, against Mr.Surya, for the offences under Sections 336,353 and 354 IPC. CBFC sent a letter to the Home Secretary, Government of Tamil Nadu, Chennai, to take action against private satellite channels under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995. Despite the existence of the said Act, those films have been shown indiscriminately in television channels during prime time. Several women associations sent complaints after complaints to the State Government and the Censor Board.The Censor Board appointed Srinivasaa Entertainments, a private detective agency, to find out, whether the uncensored obscene scenes are screened in the film ""New"". Mr.Surya, the Producer of the film, rudely behaved with the Assistant Regional Officer and lady member of the Advisory Board. On receipt of this complaint, R1 Mambalam Police, Chennai, registered a case against the Producer under Section 292 IPC and Section 7 of the Cinematograph Act. A case was registered against Mr.Surya in Crime No.1462 of 2004 on the file of F-3 Nungambakkam Police Station, Chennai, for the offences under Sections 336,353 and 35 4 IPC. There is no further action so far. The direction given by the Central Government to the Central Board of Film Certification that no picture shall be certified for public exhibition has not been given due consideration by the Board, while certifying the film.The film ""New"" does not provide a clean and healthy entertainment. The guidelines given in the Cinematograph Act,1952, that the scenes, showing children being subjected to any form of child abuse or tending to encourage and justify smoking, are not to be shown, have not been followed by the Censor Board. (9) As pointed out by the Supreme Court in 1989 (2) SUPREME COURT CASES 574 (S.RANGARAJAN v. P.JAGJIVAN RAM AND OTHERS), this is a land of Adi-guru Sankaracharya, Ramanujacharya, Madhwacharya, Chaitanya Maha Prabhu, Swami Rama Krishna Paramhamsa, Guru Nanak, Sant Kabir, Thiruvalluvar and Mahatma Gandhi, who have all enlightened our path. Supreme Court of India: This is a land of Adi-guru Sankaracharya, Ramanujacharya and Madhwacharya. In the name of new innovation, if we throw away the teaching of these great people, which is a general human morality and wisdom, we are throwing away our ethical standards and the tradition of our country into the winds. Jan: ""The film has been picturised purposely for arousing the sensual feelings of the public, depicting the theme, scenes, sequences and songs, with full of child abuse, vulgarity and obscenity"".The adult rated scenes in the film are allowed to be telecast, to enable the children also to view, in spite of the prohibition, contained in The Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act,1 995. After release of the film, the Producer attempted to introduce one more song with full of ugly meanings. A complaint has been given and the police registered a case against the Producer. The film conveys only one message, namely, vulgarity and vulgarity alone and nothing more. The film has been picturised only to show the sexual perversions and child abuse, in order to cater to the baser instincts of the viewers, purely with a commercial purpose. Innovations may be good, but those innovations should not be at the cost of culture and traditions of this great country.Keywords:Central Board of Film CertificationCinematograph ActCensorshipVulgarSrinivasanSections:Section 6Section 5 B(1) Section 5 B (2) Section 5-C(2)Section 5-ASection 292 IPCSection 7",,Ms A Arulmozhi vs The Government Of India on 5 August  2005,"[-0.01293995  0.72483695  0.29534993 -0.39351258 -0.20098028 -0.32220927

State Law Officers Assn on 25 January, 1993Equivalent citations: 1994 AIR 1654, 1994 SCR (1) 348Author: P SawantBench: Sawant, P.B.JUDGMENT: The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SAWANT,J.-Leave granted in SLP Nos. 14525 and 4912 of 1991.  2. This group of appeals raises an important question with regard to the status of the law officers engaged by the State Government to conduct the cases on its behalf in the High Court. Incidentally, questions bearing on the profession of the lawyer, his relationship with his client, and the relationship of the Government and for that matter of all the public bodies with the lawyers they engage for conducting their matters, also fall for consideration.3.U.P. State Government removed 26 of the 64 law officers in the High Court of Allahabad. Out of these, 9 had been working for a long time, some of them for more than 15 years. Another 11 officers out of the removed officers had been appointed in 1982-83 and they continued to work till the date of their removal without renewal of their term.4. The Legal Remembrancer was appointed by the State Government to be a special counsel for any special matter before the High Court. He was also given financial and administrative powers which were earlier exercised by the Chief Standing Counsel and the Public Prosecutor. Aggrieved by the order dated July 23, 1990, the law officers who were removed from their posts filed a writ petition against the order of May 26, 1990. The High Court accepted the contention of the lawyers and quashed the orders removing them from their offices.5. Chapter V of the Legal Remembrancer's Manual (hereinafter referred to as the 'Manual' deals with the Chief Standing Counsel and the Standing Counsel in the High Court and Chapter VI of the said Manual deals with Brief Holders In The High Court. Chapter VII deals with District Government Counsel with whom we are not concerned in the present appeals. Suffice it for the present to bear in mind that the appointment and conditions of engagement of District Government Councel have been dealt with separately from the appointment of the chief standing counsel and standing counsel.6. There shall be one Chief Standing Counsel for the High Court at Allahabad and another for Lucknow Bench. The State Government may entrust any case of special importance to Advocate-General or a special counsel. Paragraph 5.03 then refers to the responsibility of the Chief standing counsel for conducting the cases.7. The Chief Standing Counsel and Standing Counsel are appointed by the State Government. They may also be asked to appear on behalf of the State in civil cases in or outside Allahabad or Lucknow.8. The State Government may appoint such number of Brief Holders from amongst the practising advocates in the High Court as it may deem necessary from time to time. A Brief Holder is entitled to the same fee as would be payable to a Standing Counsel for doing similar work. No salary or any other kind of monthly remuneration is payable to the Brief Holder. In case of dispute with regard to the fee, the decision of the Legal Remembrancer is to be final. Paragraph 6.13 gives the right to private practice and also for accepting cases against the Government.9. The District Government Counsel are legal practitioners appointed by the State Government to conduct in any court other than the High Court such civil, criminal or revenue cases as may be assigned to them. The conditions of service for conducting criminal matters are the same as that of the Chief Standing Counsel and the Standing Counsel. The Legal Remembrancer has to submit confidentially in the order of preference the names of the legal practitioners to the District Magistrate. He also has to give his opinion, particularly about the character, professional conduct and integrity of the candidate and 1 (1991) 1 SCC 212: 1991 SCC (L&S) 742 forward to the District Judge.10. The District Government Counsel (Civil) is prohibited from becoming a counsel of any Municipality or Municipal Corporation. Similar restriction is placed on the Sub-District Government Counsel. However, with certain exceptions, with the prior approval of the Legal Remembrancer, they are allowed to appear.11. Legal profession is essentially a service-oriented profession. The ancestor of today's lawyer was no more than a spokesman articulating his case before' the authorities that be. The nature of the service rendered by the lawyers was private till the Government and public bodies started engaging them to conduct cases on their behalf.12. The relationship between the lawyer and his client is one of trust and confidence. The lawyer is not bound to tell the court every fact or urge every proposition of law which his client wants him to do, however irrelevant it may be. He has a duty to ensure that justice is done in all cases.13. An open invitation to lawyers to compete for the posts is by far the best mode of such selection. Public bodies may resort to other methods such as inviting and appointing the best available. Whatever the method adopted, it must be shown that the appointments were made only on the basis of merit.14. The State Government is under no obligation to consult even its Advocate-General much less the Chief Justice or any of the judges of the High Court. The State Government has a discretion. It may or may not ascertain the views of any of them while making the said appointments. The appointments may, therefore, be made on considerations other than merit and there exists no provision to prevent such appointments. Out of 26 respondents-law officers, the period of contract of nine of them had expired and they were continued till further orders. The remaining seventeen continued after the expiry of their initial term without even formal orders of extension. None of the 26 officers had any right to hold the office on the date of their removal, even under the initial terms of appointment which stipulated the contractual period.

Kannan on 17 December, 1998Equivalent citations: (1999) 2 MLJ 117Author: N BalasubramanianJUDGMENT N.V. Balasubramanian, J..An interesting question of law on the scope of Section 14 of the Hind Succession Act, 1956 arises on the facts of the case. At the time of the partition made in the year 1926, his first daughter Palaniammal was aged 10 years, his second daughter Kaliammal, the defendant in the suit, was aged 8 years and his third daughter Sornammal was aged 5 years. The plaintiff, the respondent herein, is the son of the said Rajalakshmi.The dispute in the suit arose in the following manner:. The plaintiff, as already stated, is the great grandson of Kuppuswami Chettiar through his third daughter Sornammal, the sister of the appellant. According to him, he was adopted by the appellant's husband in the year 1972 and the adoption took place according to the Hindu customs and rites by a deed of adoption dated 12.7.1972. He has filed the suit for declaration that he is the absolute owner of the suit property after the life time of his adoptive mother Kaliammal the appellant and also for permanent injunction restraining the appellant from alienating or transferring the said property to the detriment of the plaintiff.The case of the appellant was that the daughters of Kuppuswami Chettiar were to enjoy the property for their life time. In the event of any of the daughters dying without any santhathi, the property should go to other daughters and then to their santhathis. Considering the partition deed dated 23.8.1926 the trial court held that under Section 14(2) of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, the appellant had become the full owner of the suit properties and she has full power of alienation.The first appellate court, on the basis of the evidence, recorded a finding that it is not correct to state that the adoption was to the husband of the appellant and her husband alone. The court also held that under the deed of partition, the appellant had only limited interest and the rights obtained by her would fall under the provisions of Section 14(2) of the Hindu Succession Act and such interest did not enlarge as an absolute one under section 14(1) of Hindu Succession Act. 6. The first appellate court also held that under the deed of partition, the appellant had only limited interest and the rights obtained by her would fall under the provisions of Section 14(2) of the Hindu Succession Act and such interest did not enlarge as an absolute one under Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act. 4. Whether the decision of the lower appellate court is vitiated by a failure to frame specific point for determination as contemplated under Order 20, Rule 4 and Order 41, Rule 131.C.P.C.? V. Narayanasaray, learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that the view of the lower appellate court on the interpretation of See. 14 of the Hindu Succession Act Order 20, Rule 4 and Order 41, Rule 131.P.C. was plainly erroneous in law. Mr. V. Narayanasaray, learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that the view of the lower appellate court on the interpretation of See. 14 of the Hindu Succession Act was plainly erroneous in law and according to him, in the deed dated 23.8.1926 Kuppuswami Chettiar settled the property in favour of his three daughters for maintenance and the appellant, one of the daughters of Kuppuswami Chettiar, was in possession and enjoyment of the property on the date when the Hindu Succession Act came into force and she had a vestige of right of maintenance and therefore, her right would blossom into full ownership under Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act.Mrs. Prabha Sridevan, learned Counsel for the respondent, submitted that settlement in favour of a married daughter would not fall within the scope and purview of Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act. She also referred to the provisions of Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act and submitted that under the said enactment, there is no legal right of maintenance for a married girl. She submitted that the case of the appellant would squarely fall within the scope of Section 14(2) of the Hindu Succession Act.I have carefully considered the submission of the learned Counsel for the parties. The relevant clause of the deed of settlement executed by Kuppuswami Chettiar dated 23.8.1926 in favour of his three daughters reads as under:The properties mentioned in the 4th list should be shared equally by the minor daughter of the second wife, Palaniammal aged about ten years, Kaliammal and Sornammal, aged about five years and the properties should be maintained by guardians of the abovesaid minor daughters. In case any one of them does not have any issues, that share of the property should go to the other two girls and their issues after her life time. The properties mentioned in the 4th list should be shared equally by the minor daughter of the second wife of Kuppuswami Chettiar, numbered one namely (1) Palaniammal aged about ten years, (2) Kaliammal, aged about eight years, and (3) Sornammal, aged about five years and the properties should be maintained by guardians of the abovesaid minor daughters namely the aforesaid (1) Palaniappa Chettiar (d), (2) Muthuswami Chettiar, S/o. S.K. Karuppian Chettiar (b), (3) S.K. Somasundaram Chettiar, S.K. Sabapathi Chettiar and S.K. Shanmuga Sundara Chettiaf (numbered 5) Palanappa Chettiar 1st guardian of the Balasubramanian Chettiar (minor) and the 2nd guardian of the aforesaid minors C.K. Muthusami Chettiar (2) and that after spending the amount from the aforesaid properties towards the maintenance of the aforesaid minor girls and the lands and for payment of taxes and that after spending money for performing the marriage of those three girls, the balance amount from the yields and the properties mentioned in the list should be handed over equally to the respective persons not alienate the properties mentioned in the list and they should not subject it to any encumbrance and that in case if any one of them do not have any issues, that share of the property should go to the other two girls and their issues after her life time and that the guardians of the aforesaid Balasubramanian Chettiar and numbered five namely Palaniappa Chettiar 1, Muthuswami Chettiar son of C. Karuppian Chettiar 2 should spend the yield from the aforesaid properties mentioned in the 3rd list and 4th list towards the maintenance of the aforesaid minor daughters and sons and that the balance amount should be with Muthuswami Chettiar who is the 2nd guardian and he should himself perform the marriage of the said three minor daughters and sons and that he should handover the balance amount and the property after the aforesaid minor Balasubramaniam Chettiar attains majority.Section 14(1) or the provisions of Section 14(2) of the Hindu Succession Act would apply to the bequest made in favour of the appellant would depend upon the question whether a married daughter has any right to claim maintenance against her father. In Mayne's Hindu Law 14th Edition, Section 724 Chapter 23, page 1154 the learned author deals with the right of a daughter after marriage.Bai Mangal v. Bai Rukkmani (1898). I.L.R. 23 Bom. Ghose: ""The law of Narada is clear that when the husband's family is in destitute circumstances, the father's family has to maintain a female"". J.C. Ghose says, (Hindu Law, pp.295 and 296) ""The law of Narada is clear that when the husband's family is in destitute circumstances, the father's family has to maintain a female. Mr Mayne criticises Bai Mangal v. Bai Rukkmani (1898) I.R. 23 Bom. 291. According to the strict letter of the Hindu Law and also according to the constitution of Hindu Society, it is a clear legal duty on the part of the father's family to maintain a woman.Section 14(1) or 14(2) Section 21 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 also provide that there is no legal right or maintenance for a married daughter from her father. The Supreme Court in Laxmappa v. Balawa K.T. Chavdi A.I.R. 1996 N.S.C. 3497, after noticing the relevant portion in Mulla's book on Hindu Law, 15th Edition, held that the position of a married girl is some what different.Section 14(2) of the Hindu Succession Act has to be read as a proviso or an exception to Section 14(1) and comes into operation only if acquisition in any of thee methods indicated therein is made for the first time without there being any preexisting right in the female Hindu to the property. Murtaza Fazl Ali, J.N. held that Section 14-2 of the Act would apply if the property must have been acquired by way of gift, will, instrument, decree, order of the court Or by an award; or by a will or a partition. The provisions of Section 14(1) of the Act has been the subject matter of consideration before the Supreme Court in several decisions and in Tulasamma v. Sesha Reddi 99 L.W. 89 (S.N.), the Supreme Court considered the provisions of Section 14(1) of the Act and held as under:Sub-section (2) of Section 14 is more in the nature of a proviso or exception to Sub-section (1) and it was regarded' as such by this Court in Badri Parshad v. Smt. Kanso Devi . Section 14(2) of the Act would apply where a female Hindu was in possession of a property not by virtue of any pre-existing right, but otherwise and when the settlor imposes certain conditions on the settler. If the property is given to a female in lieu of preexisting right of maintenance, which existed under the Shastric Hindu Law, the restrictions, if any, imposed against her right of enjoyment of properties would not operate and her restricted right would enlarge and blossom into a full and absolute right.Section 14(2) of the Act is in the nature of a Proviso or an exception to Section 14 and comes Into operation only if acquisition in any of the methods indicated therein is made for the first time -without there being any pre-existing right in the female Hindu to the property. This view lends support to the object of the section which was to remove the disability on women imposed by law to achieve a social purpose. Thus, we affirm and, reiterate that Sub-section (2) of Section 14 will be construed more in the nature of a proviso or an exception to Sub-section (1) of Section 14 of the Act. Section 14(2) of the Act is in the nature of proviso or an exception. It comes into operation only if acquisition by any of the methods set out in the explanation to Section 14(1) is made for the first time without there being any pre existing right in the Hindu woman. The concept of a Hindu widow's estate was not relevant.The Apex Court again considered the question in the case of C. Masilamani Mudaliar V. Idol of Sri Swaminathaswami , and held as under:...if the acquisition of the property attracts Sub-section (1) of Section 14, Sub-section (2) does not come into play. The Supreme Court has reiterated the same view in Laxmappa v. Balawa K.T. Chavadi and the law laid down by the Apex Court. Sub-section (2) of Section 14 independently operates in its own sphere. The Supreme Court has given a must expansive interpretation of the Hindu Succession Act. Section 14(1) reads that any property possessed by a female Hindu, whether acquired before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be held by her as full owner and not as a limited owner. The father may not have had a legal obligation to maintain his daughter but all the same there existed a moral obligation.In the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Bhura and Ors. v. Kashiram, (1994) 2 L. W. 1, the testator therein created a life interest in favour of his daughter and intended that the property should be ultimately retained by the family. Section 14(2) of the Act mandates that nothing contained in Sub-section (1) of Section 14 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 shall apply to any property acquired by way of gift or under Will or by any other instrument prescribing a restricted right in such property. In a recent decision, the Supreme Court in the case of Raghubar Singh and Ors. v. Gulab Singh and ors (1998)5 A.D. (S.C.) 197, Dr. A.S. Anand, J. (as His Lordship then was) considered the right to maintenance of a wife. According to the Shastric Hindu Law, marriage between two Hindus is a sacrament which results in a sacred union of man and wife.In view of the decisions of the Supreme Court on the topic, I am of the view, it is not necessary to refer other decisions relied upon by the learned Counsel for the parties. Section 14(2) of the Hindu Succession Act provides for a right of maintenance in favour of widows, widows and daughters. However, where a new right is created or where for the first time a right is given in favour of a female daughter who has no preexisting right against the properties, then, the provisions of Section 14(2) of the Act alone would be attracted. Section 14(2) of the Hindu Succession Act gives married daughters a right to enjoy the property without alienation or encumbrance. If anyone of the daughters dies without issues, her share would devolve upon the other two daughters and their issues after her lifetime. Since the instrument in question has conferred a new right, title or interest on the married daughter, her rights to the properties would fall within the scope of this section. The grant was not given in recognition of any pre-existing right of maintenance of married daughters.Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act does not expand into an absolute right under Section 14(2) of this Court's decision in Kamala Bai Amma's case, (1998)2 L. W. 452. I am unable to accept the submissions of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the appellant had come vestige of right in that property. The possession of the property on the date of enactment of Hindu Successional Act would not be sufficient. I am unable to accept the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellants that the defendant/appellant continued to be in possession of the property in continuation of her old right of maintenance prior to marriage. The document in question, in my opinion, has created two different rights in favour of the appellant. The nature, content and quality of the rights are different and distinct.The second appeal filed by the defendant/appellant is liable to be dismissed and accordingly, it is dismissed. In so far as the relief of injunction is concerned, under the document the appellant was given a right to enjoy the property without alienating or creating any encumbrance over the property. It is not open to the plaintiff to pray for an injunction restricting her right of enjoyment given under that document.Keywords:Hindu Succession actMarried DaughterSection 14Kuppuswami Chettiar",,Kaliammal vs S Kannan on 17 December 1998,"[ 0.5295649  -0.17653054 -0.22516818 -0.0488483  -0.10966641  0.51519585

Nayak & Anr on 10 December, 1991 Author: B J Reddy  Bench: K.N. Singh (Cj), P.B. Sawant, N.M. Kasliwal, B.P. Jeevan Reddy, G.N.  CASE NO.:  Writ Petition (crl.)  833 of 1990  PETITIONER:  ABDUL REHMAN ANTULAY & ORS. DATE OF JUDGMENT: 10/12/1991  BENCH:  K.N. SINGH (CJ) & P.B. SAWANT & N.M. KASLIWAL & B.P. JEEVAN REDDY & G.N. .It is more than 12 years since this Court declared in Hussain Ara Khatoon : 1979CriLJ1036 that right to speedy trial is implicit in the broad sweep and content of Article 21. It is held that violation of this right entails quashing of charges and/or conviction. It is, however, contended now before us that no such fundamental right flows from Article 21. At any rate, it is argued, it is only a facet of a fair and reasonable procedure guaranteed by Article 21 and nothing more. It is also argued that violation of this right does not result in quashing of the charges and/or conviction. It is submitted that the right, if at all there is one, is an amorphous one, a right which is something less than other fundamental rights guaranteed by our Constitution. On the other hand, proponents of the right want us to go a step forward and prescribe a time limit beyond which no criminal proceeding should be allowed to go on. Without such a limit, they say, the right remains a mere illusion and a platitude. Proponents of several view points have put forward their respective contentions. First, how these matters have come to be posted before the Constitution Bench. Writ Petition No. 268/87 and a few other criminal appeals came up before a Division Bench when it was urged for the accused that a time limit be fixed for concluding all criminal proceedings. Without such a time limit, it was argued, the guarantee of right to speedy trial will remain a mere platitude. Judge, the accused raised an objection that the said Special case can be tried only by a Special Judge appointed by the Government under the 1952 Act and that a Judge of the High Court has no jurisdiction to try it. This and some other objections raised by the accused were rejected by the learned Judge, bound as he was by the aforesaid direction of this Court. Later the proceedings were transferred to  who framed 21 charges but declined to frame charges under 22 other heads proposed by the complainant. The complainant came to this Court against the said order in so far as it declined to frame certain charges which matter was ultimately disposed of in 1986. The proceedings were then transferred to and taken up by P. of Bombay High Court, who framed as many as 79 charges and proceeded with the trial. Constitution W. Special Leave was granted in the above matters and further proceedings in the High Court stayed. Article 32 and the appeals arising from the said Special Leave Petitions were referred to and taken up by a Seven-Judge Bench of this Court. The Seven-Judge Bench, however, delinked W. April 29, 1988, the Bench allowed the Appeal arising from Special Leave Petition and quashed all the proceedings in the said Special Case taken subsequent to the directions of this Court contained in its judgment dated 16th February, 1984 . The Division Bench was of the opinion that the said contention ""raises a very important constitutional question"" which ""is likely to arise more often in many cases and that, the decision on the question will have far-reaching consequences in tens of thousands of criminal cases pending in courts all over the country"". Accordingly, the Bench directed the cases to be placed before a Constitution Bench. Though several cases are posted before us, we indicated to the counsel that we will not enter into or investigate the factual aspects in all the cases but shall take the facts of only the first two cases. We indicated that we will dispose of these two cases, namely, W.P. No. 268 of 1987 (Ranjan Dwivedi v. State) and relegate the other cases to a Division Bench, after laying down the appropriate principles. We shall first notice the facts of these two cases before we advert to respective contentions of the parties. 833/90 The petitioner in W.P. No. 833 of 199C, A.R. Antulay was the Chief Minister of Maharashtra from 1980 to January, 1982. The complainant/respondent R.S. Nayak moved the Governor of Maharashtra by his application dated September 1, 1981 requesting him to grant sanction to prosecute the accused- petitioner as required by Section 6 of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (hereinafter referred to as `1947 Act`) for various offences alleged to have been committed by him. Without waiting for the Governor`s response on his application he filed a complaint in the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bombay on September 11, 1981 (Criminal Case No. 76 (Misc.)/81) against the accused and some others. His case was that the petitioner- accused was a public servant within the meaning of Section 21 I.P.C. and that he has committed several offences punishable under Sections 161, 165 I.P.C. and Section 5 of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 as also under Sections 383 and 420 I.P.C. read with Sections 109 and 120-B I.P.C. The learned Magistrate called upon the complainant to satisfy him as to how the complaint is maintainable without a valid sanction required by Section 6 of 1947 Act. After hearing the parties, he held that in absence of such a sanction, the complaint was not maintainable except with reference to offences under Sections 384 and 420 read with 109 and 120-B I.P.C. This order was questioned by the complainant in the High Court of Bombay by way of Special Criminal Application No. 1742 of 1981. Meanwhile one Sri P.B. Samant filed a Writ Petition against the petitioner-accused alleging several acts of abuse of power including many of those alleged in the complaint filed by R.S. Nayak. The Writ Petition was allowed on 12th January, 1982 as a result of which the petitioner resigned from the office of the Chief Minister. Special Criminal Application No. 1742 of 1981 filed by the complainant was dismissed by the High Court on April 12, 1982. Against the order, State of Maharashtra applied to this Court for Special Leave, which was declined on July 28, 1982. On the same day, however, the Governor of Maharashtra granted sanction under Section 6 of 1947 Act in respect of offences set out therein.

CORAM :-
HONBLE MR. JUSTICE A.K. SIKRIWhether the Judgment should be reported in the Digest? This conundrum relates to child trafficking. The petitioner is a domestic servant , driven by poverty, working as domestic servant in various houses from time to time to earn the minimum livelihood for her family and sustaining the family for fulfilling the daily needs. The respondent No. , Sahyog Placement Sanstha is a placement agency, which makes arrangements for providing domestic helps to the residents of this city. Sometime in March, 1999, the petitioner handed over her daughter to this Sanstha, whose sole proprietor is Sunita Sen, for placement of her daughter as domestic help in some residence. The reason was that the petitioner had fallen serious sick for a long duration, which compelled her to stay at home, as she was not able to work because of the said sickness. Family, in any case, needed sustenance as there was nobody else to support the family financially, no alternative was left to the petitioner to compel her daughter Jharna to take up work. Jharna started working as domestic help at the residence of respondent No. The petitioner pleads that with great difficulty, she managed to get the phone number of her daughter?s employer and tried to contact her daughter, Jharna on that phone. However, she was not permitted to talk with Jharna. The petitioner was disturbed and tensed at the sudden disappearance of her daughter, but could not be able to comprehend whom to approach for the help. She went to the respondent No. 4 again and respondent No. 4 had arranged the petitioner to talk with her daughter Jharna on telephone. However, she had no idea where the respondent No. She along with her son went to the Noida house, the address whereof was provided to the petitioner on phone. However, she could not be able to meet her daughter there. Her continues requests made to respondent No. While she was reconciling with the tragedy that had struck her, after a lapse of one and a half years or so, she was informed that her daughter Jharna was missing since 29.08.2000 and the missing complaint had been lodged by Jharna?s employer on 06.09.2000 to enquire about her daughter. The petitioner was shocked to hear this and got in touch with the respondent No. In these circumstances, the petitioner had no other option left but to approach the police station and to seek help to trace her daughter. The petitioner, viz. , had approached the Juvenile Welfare Board and filed a case. The JWB acted promptly on the petitioner?s complaint and summoned the respondent No. 4 to attend the hearings but they did not consider it as important enough to attend the hearing and give the information they had regarding the whereabouts of the petitioner?s daughter. However, case did not progress much due to non-appearance of the respondent No. On 23.05.2002, she filed the instant petition in the nature of habeas corpus seeking direction against the respondent No. 4 to produce the petitioner?s daughter, Jharna forthwith. The State of NCT Delhi is impleaded in petition as the respondent No. 1, the Commissioner of Police as respondent No. , Vasant Kunj Police Station as respondent No. 3, Sahyog Placement Sanstha as respondent No. 4 and Juvenile Welfare Board was impleaded as respondent No. Juvenile Welfare Board will ensure that record is produced in Court alongwith the statement of respondent No. 50/2001, this Court deemed it fit and proper to transfer the case to Anti-Kidnapping Cell, Crime Branch, Delhi Police to carry out further investigation and trace out the petitioner?s daughter. The Court also directed the employer of Jharna, viz. The matter went on from time to time, thereafter giving directions to the police time and again to trace out the missing girl, Jharna. At the same time, the issue of exploitation of children working as domestic helps and children going missing in the process was also taken note of. During the discussions in this case, it transpired that many such placement agencies would place children, initially at some residence for domestic helps, but such children would ultimately be forced into the flesh-trade. Arpana Bhatt that there are as many as 123 such agencies functioning in Delhi. These agencies apart from other placement work carried on by them engage themselves in placement of children in various establishments including as domestic help. The result is that children who are either picked up from the streets or brought from various other States to Delhi are first placed as domestic help and later shifted to other more hazardous work including some who are pushed into prostitution. She submits that while section 31 of the said Act vests the Juvenile Child Welfare Committees with extensive powers, the absence of appropriate rules and regulations for the exercise of that power has virtually rendered the said provision nugatory. She states that the Child welfare Committees functioning in Delhi have received a number of complaints regarding abuse of the children working as domestic helps in households. The Secretary, Social Welfare Department, Government of Delhi shall also remain present and indicate whether any rules have been framed or can be framed in terms of Section 68 read with 31 of the Act aforementioned to regulate the exercise of the powers by the committees and in particular to regulate the functioning of the placement agencies dealing with domestic child labour. ""Magnitude of the problem was taken note of in the orders of 25.10.2004 when the Chairman of Child Welfare Committee submitted their report in this behalf. "" The Secretary, Social Welfare Department, Govt. of Delhi and the Chairman of one of the Child Welfare Committees functioning in Delhi are both present in person in obedience to the direction issued by this court on 4th October, 2004. The Chairman of the Child Welfare Committee stated that there were a large number of complaints received by the Committee from time to time suggesting abuse of domestic child labour. She submits that the Committee is often handicapped in dealing with such complaints because of lack of particulars regarding the placement agency and the employers. The Secretary, Social Welfare Department, Govt. of Delhi, on the other hand, submits that the question whether rules can and ought to be framed to regulate the functioning of the placement agencies is a matter that shall have to be examined in greater detail at the Government level, before any definite step is taken in these proceedings. He seeks six weeks? time to have the matter examined and to place on record an affidavit indicating the stand of the Delhi State Government in regard to the need and possibility of framing of rules under Sections 31 and 68 of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2000. Jharna was ultimately traced out and the custody was handed over to the petitioner. Thereafter, this petition has proceeded to tackle the issues to regulate the functioning of the placement agencies especially who were dealing with domestic child labour and provides women and children as domestic help so that such incidents do not occur in future through the instrumentalities of these placement agencies. ""The petitioner in this writ petition as ""Bachpan Bachao?, another N. In this public interest litigation, the problem which is highlighted is that several thousand minors are kidnapped and trafficked from various states and brought to Delhi and sold for the purposes of prostitution, begging, drugpeddling, slavery, forced labour including bondage, and for various other crimes and who are still stranded in various parts of Delhi against their wishes and are waiting to be rescued. ",,Bachpan Bachao _ Ors vs Union Of India _ Others on 24 December 2010,"[-0.29591075  0.0791741   0.30107412 -0.45616305 -0.53688747 -0.35694566

Ojha, C.J.JShri Lahoti appeared for the Commissioner of Income-tax, while Shri J.P. Gupta appeared for the assessee. During the course of arguments in this case, learned counsel for the parties made a statement today that another Miscellaneous Civil Case No. 97 of 1983 in which a similar question was involved and in which also the assessee was represented by Shri J.P. Gupta and Shri Lahoti appeared for the Commissioner of Income-tax, be also taken up and decided along with the Miscellaneous Civil Case No. 43 of 1983. In view of the joint request made by learned counsel for both parties, we sent for the record of Miscellaneous Civil Case No. 97 of 1983 and are deciding the same along with this Miscellaneous Civil Case No. 43 of 1983. The question of law which has been referred by the Tribunal in Miscellaneous Civil Case No. The judgment in the present Miscellaneous Civil Case No. 43 of 1983 shall govern the disposal of Miscellaneous Civil Case No. 97 of 1983 also. The questions of law referred in these two cases are apparently identical. Before answering these questions, it would be necessary to give in a nutshell the relevant facts in each of these two cases. The facts of Miscellaneous Civil Case No. 43 of 1983 are that the assessee is a registered firm executing contract work. It was required to file its return for the year 1973-74 which was delayed. Consequently, penalty proceedings were initiated by the Income-tax Officer for late filing of the return and ultimately, a penalty of Rs. 5,210 was imposed on the assessee. On appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner cancelled the penalty on the ground that penal action was not appropriate inasmuch as there was no default in paying the tax. This view was upheld by the Tribunal in its appellate order. On an application being made by the Commissioner of Income-tax, the question of law referred to above was referred to this court by the Tribunal for its opinion. The facts of Miscellaneous Civil Case No. 97 of 1983, on the other hand, are that the assessee too is a registered firm. It was required to file its return in regard to the assessment year 1975-76. However, the return was not filed within time and there was a default of 10 months in doing so. The Income-tax Officer in this case also initiated proceedings of penalty under Section 271 of the Act and a penalty of Rs. 7,886 was imposed. In appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner reversed the order of the Income-tax Officer. It took the view that since the assessee had not only paid the entire amount of the tax, but he had also paid more tax and indeed a sum of Rs. 2,340 was liable to be refunded to him, no case for imposition of penalty was made out. This view was affirmed by the Tribunal and the second appeal preferred by the Commissioner of Income-tax was dismissed. In this case also, the Tribunal, on an application being made in this behalf by the Commissioner of Income-tax, referred the above question of law to this court for its opinion. It is in this manner that these two Miscellaneous Civil Cases have come up before us. The answer to the questions referred in these two cases depends on an interpretation of the provisions of Sub-sections and of Section 271 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 . Since the entire provisions of Sub-section of Section 271 of the Act are not for consideration before us, we refer only to that portion of Section 271 of the Act on which reliance has been placed by learned counsel for the parties. Clause including its Explanation was substituted by the Direct Taxes Act, 1974, with retrospective effect from April 1, 1962. Some amendment therein has been made by the Taxation Laws Act, 1975. «271. If the Income-tax Officer or the Appellate Assistant Commissioner or the Commissioner in the course of any proceedings under this Act, is satisfied that any person-has without reasonable cause failed to furnish the return of total income which he was required to furnish under Subsection of Section 139 or by notice given under Sub-section of Section 139 or Section 148 or has without reasonable cause failed to furnish it within the time allowed and in the manner required by Sub-section of Section 139 or by such notice, as the case may be, or has without reasonable cause failed to comply with a notice under Sub-section of Section 142 or Sub-section of Section 143 or fails to comply with a direction issued under Sub-section , or has concealed the particulars of his income or furnished inaccurate particulars of such income, he may direct that such person shall pay by way of penalty-in the cases referred to in Clause --... in any other case, in addition to the amount of the tax, if any, payable by him, a sum equal to two per cent. of the assessed tax for every month during which the default continued. Explanation.--In this clause, 'assessed tax' means tax as reduced by the sum, if any, deducted at source under Chapter XVII-B or paid in advance under Chapter XVII--C». «When the person liable to penalty is a registered firm or an unregistered firm which has been assessed under Clause of Section 183, then, notwithstanding anything contained in the other provisions of this Act, the penalty imposable under Sub-section shall be the same amount as would be imposable on that firm if that firm were an unregistered firm». It has been urged by Shri Lahoti, appearing for the Department, that Clauses , and of Sub-section of Section 271 which constitute the first part are the charging provisions, whereas Clause occurring after the words «he may direct that such person shall pay by way of penalty» contains the provision only in regard to the quantification of penalty and has no bearing in determining the question as to whether an assessee is liable to penalty or not. According to him, if any of the defaults contemplated by Clauses , or has been committed by an assessee, he becomes liable to penalty and the question as to what amount of penalty, if any, should be imposed on him, is to be decided in the manner provided for in Clause referred to above. It has further been urged by Shri Lahoti that once the assessee is found to be liable to penalty, having committed any of the defaults contemplated by Clauses, and of Sub-section of Section 271 of the Act and the said assessee happens to be a registered firm, Sub-section of Section 271 of the Act is immediately attracted and for the purpose of determining the quantum of penalty to be determined under Clause , the registered firm has to be treated as an unregistered firm. For the assessees in these two cases, on the other hand, it has been urged by their learned counsel that Section 271 which alone is relevant for the purpose of the present two cases inasmuch as it is that sub-section which has been taken recourse to in the instant cases on the ground that the assessees had, without reasonable cause, failed to furnish the return of total income, has to be read with Clause together with its Explanation even for deciding the question as to whether the assessee is liable to penalty or not. According to him, the mere fact that Clause has been placed separately from Clauses , and and at a place relevant for determination of the amount of penalty, it cannot be said that the said Sub-clause and the Explanation attached thereto had to be ignored for determining the question as to whether the assessee is liable to penalty or not. It was urged that the very purpose of inserting the Explanation in Clause was to find out as to whether there was any assessed tax or not payable by the assessee. According to him, in those cases where, on account of the tax being deducted at source under Chapter XVII-B or being paid in advance under Chapter XVII-C, there is no tax liability, the assessee will not be liable to penalty notwithstanding the fact that he may have failed to furnish the return of total income without reasonable cause. The view propounded by learned counsel for the assessee, as seen above, has found favour with the Tribunal. In order to find out the true import of Sub-section and Sub-section of Section 271 of the Act, it is necessary to refer to certain decided cases: We shall first refer to those cases on which reliance has been placed by learned counsel for the Department. In CIT v. S.K Angidi Chettiar 44 ITR 739 , Section 28 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, came up for consideration. While dealing with the provisions of Section 28 of that Act with reference to a registered firm, it was held : «The assumption that the expression 'any tax' used in Section 28 is intended to indicate that there must be some tax payable by the assessee before penalty could be imposed is wholly unwarranted. The futility of the assumption is exhibited by the terms of Clause . Penalty may be imposed for failure to comply with the notice under Sub-section of Section 22 or Sub-section of Section 23 even if the assessee has no assessable income. To the imposition of a penalty, liability to pay tax by the person against whom the penalty is sought to be imposed is, therefore, not a condition precedent». In CIT v. R. Ochhavlal and Co. 105 ITR 518 where Section 271 itself of the Act came up for consideration, it was held that the penal liability contemplated by Sub-section of Section 271 falls within any of the Clauses , or of Section 271 of the Act which contemplated three distinct types of defaults. The moment it is found that any one of these three defaults is committed by an assessee which is a registered firm, the said assessee becomes «liable to penalty» within the meaning of Sub-section . It was pointed out that Clauses , and constitute the first part of Subsection of Section 271 of the Act. This part indicated when and under what circumstances a penal liability came into existence. The second part of Sub-section of Section 271 was constituted by Clauses , and . The function of Clauses , and was to create a penal liability, whereas the function of Clauses , and was to quantify the said liability. With reference to Subsection of Section 271 of the Act, it was held that if a registered firm had committed any of the defaults contemplated by Clauses , and of Section 271, it follows that the registered firm in question was a person «liable to penalty »within the meaning of Section 271. When it was found that such a registered firm had rendered itself liable to penalty, then, under the deeming fiction which was contemplated by the latter part of Sub-section , such a firm should be treated as an unregistered firm and the quantification of penalty should be worked out on the amount which would be imposable on the firm as if it were an unregistered firm. After computation as contemplated by Section 271, if it could not be said that it was not liable to any tax, then it would not be impossible to work out the penalty contemplated by the relevant clause. The same principle was reiterated by the Madras High Court in CIT v. Kandaswami Weaving Factory and Co. 110 ITR 84. It was held that Section 271 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, dealt with the quantum of penalty imposable in the case of a registered firm and for that purpose, created a fiction. The effect of Section 271 was to treat a registered firm as an unregistered firm, compute the income of the unregistered firm and assess the tax payable by the said unregistered firm on the income so computed and calculate penalty on that basis. The contention that in view of the amendment to Section 271 of the Act by the Direct Taxes Act, 1974, no penalty could be imposed on a registered firm which had paid the entire tax before the imposition of penalty, was found to be without substance. In Todarmal Safarishmal Lashkar v. CIT 118 ITR 759 , after referring to the relevant provisions of Section 271 of the Act, it was held that the language of the section was abundantly clear and certain. Penalty could be imposed only under one or more of the circumstances mentioned in Clauses , and of Sub-section of Section 271 of the Act and the quantum of penalty was prescribed in Clauses , and of the same sub-section. It was further emphasised that the incometax authorities were empowered to impose penalty only if there existed one or more circumstances enumerated in Clauses , and , but not otherwise. But where any of these circumstances existed, the authority had power to impose penalty. In CIT v. Priya Gopal Bishoyee 127 ITR 778, it was held by the Calcutta High Court that Subsection of Section 271 of the Act provides that when a person liable to penalty is a registered firm or an unregistered firm which had been assessed under Clause of Section 183 then, notwithstanding anything contained in the other provisions of this Act, the penalty imposable under Sub-section shall be the same amount as would be imposable on that firm as if that firm were an unregistered firm. Therefore, for the purpose of imposition of penalty, the firm, even if it is registered, and, if it has committed a default as contemplated under Section 271, it would be treated on the same basis as if it was an unregistered firm. It was pointed out that as an unregistered firm, the tax in the circumstances would have been, as would be borne out from the facts on record, Rs. 15,805 but if it was a registered firm; then the tax payable would have been Rs. 5,657.44. This sum of Rs. 5,657.44 had been paid on September 20, 1967, while the order for the imposition of penalty was passed subsequent thereto on June 26, 1969.",,Commissioner Of Income Tax vs Bhabuti Contractor on 13 March 1987,"[ 0.29225874  0.03213524 -0.20444185 -0.5702482  -0.4845013   1.185501

Ramakrishna (Huf) on 28 July, 2006Bench: M Singh, S YahyaORDER Mahavir Singh, J.M.These two appeals, one by the revenue and one by the assessee are directed against two different orders of the Commissioner . The appeal of the assessee in ITA No. 783/Mad/2001 is against the order of the Commissioner -XII, Chennai dated 19-2-2001 confirming the order of the assessing officer regarding refusal to recognize the partition of HUF under Section 171 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. 907/Mad/2001 is directed against the order of the Commissioner -XII, dated 19-2-2001 in respect of the assessment framed by the assessing officer under Section 143 of the Act. The only issue in this appeal relates to confirming the order of the assessing officer by the Commissioner in regard to refusal to grant recognition to the family partition of HUF under Section 171 of the Act which took place on 16-9-1994. The briefly stated facts of the case are that the assessee HUF, of Shri P. Ramakrishna consists of Shri P. Saranya Ramakrishna. Ramakrishna, his wife, Smt. Hymavathi Ramakrishna and two daughters. Under this oral partition, the two daughters, Ms. Samyuktha Ramakrishna and Ms. Saranya Ramakrishna were allotted Rs. In the said partition, all other properties of HUF were allotted to Sri P. Ramakrishna. Samyuktha Ramakrishna, Shri P. Ramakrishna was allotted all the properties indicated in Schedule II, besides all liabilities of the HUF existing on the date of partition and other liabilities that may be attributable to the undivided HUF besides any other liability not specifically allocated to any other person under the terms of the partition. The petition was proceeded by the assessing officer who vide his order dated 17-3-1998 held that partition is sham one and the mere contrivance to divest the family funds to reduce the incidence of tax and accordingly he declined to grant recognition to the partition in exercise of his powers under Section 171 of the Act. Ramakrishna who is Karta of HUF is allotted immovable properties at Schedule I which consist of one flat on the third floor of the property No. Apart from the above immovable properties, he has been allotted all shares, bank balances, all monies receivable by family together with corresponding liabilities and both the daughters, Ms. Saranya Ramakrishna were allotted a sum of Rs. 12,50,000 each which was reported to be the loans due from these daughters to the HUF Before the assessing officer, it was claimed that the partition is on the basis of recently brought out amendment to the Hindu Succession Act, i. , Hindu Succession by Tamil Nadu Assembly. By making an amendment to the Succession Act, what the legislature has intended to enact was, to provide an opening by way of right for the female members of the family out of the ancestral property belonging to the family, whenever a partition takes place. The contradistinction in this context is that a mere right and not inherent right has been provided which is sui juris to the limited extent of enforcing a clear right over the property, on par with the sons of the family, in the event of partition. In this case, partition is reported to have been effected unilaterally and recourse is had to be amendment made by the Tamil Nadu Amendment Act. The amendment does not enjoin a right on the female members to ensure an inherent right of partition.  Hymavathi Ramakrishna has not been provided any sum for her maintenance in the declaration of partition. The Commissioner has held that the provisions of Section 171 of the Act cannot confer any right to a partition which is not available to any person under the Hindu Law and according to him, under the Hindu Law, there should be a partition between two or more coparceners and therefore, it cannot be a partition where the HUF consists of only one coparcener. Finally, he held that even after introduction of amendment in Tamil Nadu in 1989, the daughters cannot claim partition in the joint family property of the HUF and accordingly, he confirmed the action of the assessing officer. Aggrieved, the assessee is in second appeal before the Tribunal. Before us, the learned Counsel for the assessee filed a paper book containing the following documents at pp. The Hindu Succession Act, 1989-Act No. Hindu Succession Act, 2005 . Statement of facts and grounds of appeal before Commissioner -in the appeal against order under Section 171 of the Act-may be taken as written submissions in the present appeal before the Honble Tribunal. Similar is the amendment of the Hindu Succession Act, 1989 as per Chapter II-A. succession by survivorship. He further argued that the Honble Apex Court has laid down the principle regarding the concept of partition that the legislature has in mind cannot be equated with a mere severance of the status of the joint family which can be effected by an expression of a mere desire by a family member to do so. Where a partition of the property is effected by metes and bounds, the daughters cannot be deprived of the benefits conferred by the Act. According to the learned Counsel for the assessee, the Honble Supreme Court has held that the legislation is beneficial and placed on the statute book with the avowed object of benefiting daughter which is a vulnerable section of the society in all its strata, it is necessary to give a liberal effect to it. Further he argued that as per the amended provisions in the Hindu Succession Act, the difference between daughter and son of the Mitakshara Hindu family is removed and the daughter is conferred the coparcenary rights in the joint family property by birth in the same manner and to the same extent as the son. In view of the new provisions, daughter is entitled to claim partition of HUF. Hence, family partition of Shri P. Ramakrishna is perfectly in accordance with the provisions of law and the same should be recognized as a family partition under Section 171 of the Act. The learned departmental Representative relied on the orders of the lower authorities and supported the orders as these are based on judicial pronouncements as mentioned in the order of the Commissioner . First of all, we have to go through the case law of the Honble Apex Court cited supra wherein by way of amendment, Section 29A was introduced by Hindu Succession Act, 1986. Equal rights to daughter in coparcenary property. » The Honble Apex Court has considered the issue regarding the preliminary decree which has already been passed prior to the amended provisions and the High Court committed an error in directing the Trial court to allot shares to the unmarried daughters. This was pleaded before the Honble Apex Court. The Honble Apex Court has admitted that under the unamended Act, unmarried daughters of a Hindu Mitakshara family were not entitled to any share in the joint family property. « Clause of the section provides that a daughter shall be allotted share like a son in the same manner treating her to be a son at the partition of the joint family property. However, the legislature was conscious that prior to the enforcement of the amending Act, partitions will already have taken place in some families and arrangements with regard to the disposition of the properties would have been made and marriage expenses would have been incurred, etc. The legislature, therefore, did not want to unsettle the settled positions. Hence, it enacted Clause providing that Clause would not apply to a daughter married prior to the partition or to a partition which had already been effected before the commencement of the amending Act. Thus, if prior to the partition of family property a daughter had been married, she was disentitled to any share in the property. Similarly, if the partition had been effected before 5-9-1985 the date on which the amending Act came into force, the daughter even though unmarried was not given a share in the family property. A partition of the joint Hindu family can be effected by various modes, viz. , by a family settlement, by a registered instrument of partition, by oral arrangement by the parties, or by a decree of the court. When a suit for partition is filed in a court, a preliminary decree is passed determining shares of the members of the family. The final decree follows, thereafter, allotting specific properties and directing the partition of the immovable properties by metes and bounds. Unless and until the final decree is passed and the allottees of the shares are put in possession of the respective property, the partition is not complete.

Yousuf Miya etc.Date of judgment:    20/11/1996Bench: k. Ramaswamy, g.t. nanavati, k. Venkataswami.Judgment: with civil appeal NO.15420-22 OF 1996 (Arising out of SLP (C) Nos.16386, 16868 and 16920 of 1996) O R D E R Leave granted.
AbstractThe facts in appeal arising out of SLP (C) No.16342/96 are sufficient for disposal of the common controversy raised in these cases.This appeal by special leave arises from the judgment of the Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, made on June 18, 1996 in W.P. No.612 of 1996. The appellants had initiated disciplinary proceedings against the respondent on the imputation that on September 15, 1995 while driving the Corporation's double-decker vehicle near Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad city, due to lack of anticipation, he had caused an accident in which a cyclist died. Consequently, action was initiated for misconduct and enquiry was ordered for misconduct under Regulation 28(ix) of the Employees Conduct Rules, 1963. It would appear that prosecution has been launched by the police for an offence punishable under Section 304, Part II, IPC and in some cases under Section 338 IPC and they are pending trial. Therefore, the respondents filed writ petition in the High Court for stay of the departmental proceedings. The learned single Judge stayed the proceedings. On appeal, the Division Bench confirmed the same. Thus, these appeals by special leave.It is contended by Sri Altaf Ahmad, the learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the appellants that the High Court was not right in directing stay of the departmental enquiry on the ground that is would cause prejudice to the respondents at the trial. In the criminal case, the question is the culpability of rash and negligent driving of the respondent. In the departmental enquiry, the misconduct relates to his failure to anticipate the accident and prevention thereof by his conduct. While interfering with that view and holding that the employer is entitled to initiate the disciplinary proceedings, after the acquittal, this Court made an observation that the employer fairly had stayed its hands till the conclusion of the criminal case so that it would not be contended that the employer intended to over-reach the judicial proceedings. That observation, far from helping the respondents, would go to show that it would be open to the employer to take appropriate disciplinary acting based upon the fact situation; whether it could be proceeded with or not would be left to the disciplinary authority and the facts and circumstance obtainable in each case required to be considered.The rival contentions give rise to the question: whether it would be right to stay the criminal proceedings pending departmental enquiry? This Court in Meena's case had elaborately considered the entire case law including Kusheshwar Dubey's case relieving the necessity to consider them once over.The purpose of departmental enquiry and of prosecution are two different and distinct aspects. The criminal prosecution is launched for an offence in violation of a duty the offender owes to the society or for breach of which law has provided that the offender shall make satisfaction to the public. So crime is an act of commission in violation of law or of omission of public duty. The departmental enquiry is to maintain discipline in the service and efficiency of public service. Each case requires to be considered in the backdrop of its own facts and circumstances. There would be no bar to proceed simultaneously with departmental enquiry and trial of a criminal case unless the charge in the criminal trial is of grave nature involving complicated questions of fact and law. Offence generally implies infringement of public, as distinguished from mere private rights punishable under criminal law. When trial for criminal offence is conducted it should be in accordance with proof of the offence as per the evidence defined under the offence as per the evidence defined under the provisions of the Evidence Act. The enquiry in a departmental proceedings relates to conduct of breach of duty of the delinquent officer to punish him for his misconduct defined under the relevant statutory rules or law. That the strict standard of proof or applicability of the Evidence Act The nature of evidence in criminal trial is entirely different from the departmental proceedings. In the former, prosecution is to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt on the touchstone of human conduct.  The evidence also is different from the standard point of Evidence Act. The evidence required in the departmental enquiry is not regulated by Evidence Act. It is always a question of fact to be considered in each case depending on its own facts and circumstances. In this case, we have seen that the charge is failure to anticipate the accident and prevention thereof. It has nothing to do with the culpability of the offence under Sections 304A and 338 IPC. Under these circumstances, the High Court was not right in staying the proceedings.The appeals are accordingly allowed. No. costs.

AbstractW.P.(MD)No.8355 of 2011 has been preferred under Article 226 of the Constitution of India praying for the issue of a writ of mandamus to direct the third respondent to constitute a special investigating team led by a gender sensitive police officer not below the rank of D.S.P consisting of experienced and sensitive police officers preferably female and to transfer the investigation ofCrime No.331 of 2011 from the fourth respondent to the newly constituted special team for the effective investigation of the case in the light of the guidelines evolved by the Honorable Supreme Court in Delhi Domestic Working Women Forum Vs. Union of India and Sakshi Vs. Union of India and directing the second respondent to take necessary steps to restore confidence among the girl students of the Government High School, Podhumbu by involving Child Welfare Committee and other agencies if necessary.W.P.(MD)No.12572 of 2011 has been preferred under Article 226 of the Constitution of India praying for the issue of a writ of mandamus to direct the first respondent to grant compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- to the petitioner's daughter who is a victim of sexual abuse perpetrated by the 7th respondent and to implement the constitutional safeguards and guidelines issued by the Apex Court for speedy trial, victim protection, legal assistance and manner of conducting the trial in Cr.No.331 of 2011 without causing any embarrassment to the victim children.In order to examine the incidence of sexual abuse among child respondents, the questionnaire was administered to 12,447 children belonging to the five different categories including children in family environment, children in schools, children in institutions, children at work and street children. The study looked into four severe forms and five other forms of sexual abuse. Out of the total child respondents, 53.22% reported having faced one or more forms of sexual abuse that included severe and other forms. Among them 52.94% were boys and 47.06% girls. An unfortunate parent of a girl child studying 7th standard in the Government High School at Podumbu, a village near Madurai, is before this court in these two writ petitions. Both writ petitions raise a question of serious concern regarding a rampant child sex abuse allegedly done by a person who is no other than the Headmaster of the School. When the writ petition came up on 27.7.2011, this court on finding that the Headmaster of the school was placed under suspension, had directed the Chief Educational Officer, Madurai to be added as sixth respondent in the writ petition. Three other persons along with the Chief Educational Officer also got impleaded including the Director of Social Welfare, Chennai. When the matter came up on 05.08.2011, the report of the Child Welfare Committee was received by the court in a sealed cover. Thereafter the matter was adjourned to 10.8.2011. On that day, the fifth respondent Headmaster through his counsel sought for time to file a counter affidavit. The officer in-charge was directed to independently investigate and to take all necessary assistance including a child Psychologist if necessary. Even during the pendency of these proceedings, the very same parent filed the second writ petition seeking for a direction to grant compensation of Rs.2 lakhs to the writ petitioner's daughter who was the victim of child sex abuse perpetrated by the Headmaster of the School and for implementing the constitutional safeguards and guidelines by the Apex Court for speedy trial, victim protection, legal assistance and also the guidelines for conducting trial in Crime No.331/2011 without causing any embarrassing  to the victim children.He used to touch their breast and asking the girl children to hold his penis. He used to take pictures in his camera and undressed the children privately. The children who protested were threatened by him by stating that he will fail them in the examinations. Many a times, he had inflicted corporalpunishment leading to blood injuries. Because of this, her daughter was afraid to go to school. During the night time, she was blabbering in her sleep and also had not taken her food properly. One relative of the Headmaster by name Amali Rosi and a teacher by name Shanmuga Kumarasamy were also helping him (arraigned as R7 and R8 in the writ petition). Therefore, appropriate action was sought for.The fact finding committee found that between 2009-2011, around 100 girl children were affected by the sexual abuses made by the headmaster. He had also taken their pictures in wrong angles when the children cleaning the floor and doing Yoga. He also touched the inner part of the children.In the counter affidavit, dated Nil (September, 2011) filed by the first respondent State, with reference to formation of Child Welfare Committee in terms of Commission for Protection of Child Right Act, 2005, it was averred in paragraphs 2 and 3 as follows:""2.It is submitted that regarding the direction of the Hon'ble High Court that is to file a report to Hon'ble High Court as to whether a State Commission in terms of Commission for protection of Child Right Act 2005, has been constituted, it is humbly submitted that the subject matter for constitution of State Commission in terms of Commission for Protection of Child Right Act 2005 is dealt by the Social Welfare and Nutritious Meal Programme Department in the Government of Tamil Nadu and that department also has stated that the proposal to constitute State Commission for Protection of Child Rights is under consideration of the Government in Social Welfare and Nutritious Meal Programme Department.3.In the above circumstances, it is reported that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased t o not that the Government of Tamil Nadu is pursuing the matter to constitute State Commission for protection of Child Rights under Child Right Act 2005.""In this context, the investigation file produced by the police showed that already statements have been recorded from several girl children and their parents under Section 161(3) of Cr.P.C. Subsequent to take over of investigation by the new Investigating Officer, only attempt was made to secure Arockiasamy who moved this court for getting bail. His mobile phone was also seized and has been sent for forensic studies. In this case, admittedly, number of school children belonged to SC community were sexually exploited by the headmaster of the school. Admittedly, the complaints of the children and their parents were if found proved would attract Section 3(1)(xi) and (xii) of the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. Directions to Investigating Officer : The Investigating Officer need not all over again record the statements already recorded under Section 161(3) and file an appropriate final report after completing the other formalities with the existing statements recorded plus additional investigation done by her as expeditiously as possible. The court also should not allow the children to be brought again and again and also to prevent the accused or the counsel from cross examine them directly and has to provide safeguards.Appointment of a Special Public Prosecutor : .It must be noted that Section 26 of the Commissions for Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005 enables the State Government to specify a public prosecutor or appoint an advocate who has been in practice as an advocate for not less than seven years, as a Special Public Prosecutor for the purpose of conducting cases in the court. It is necessary to refer to Section 26 of the Commissions for Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005, which reads as follows: ""26.Special Public Prosecutor.-For every Children's Court, the State Government shall, by notification, specify a Public Prosecutor or appoint an advocate who has been in practice as an advocate for not less than seven years, as a Special Public Prosecutor for the purpose of conducting cases in that Court.""Compensation for the victims : As to the quantum of compensation, sufficient guidelines are available in the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules found under Section 21 read with Rule 12(4) and Annexure-I.

AbstractM/s. Sabura Textiles, Thanjavur filed a private complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against V.S.Krishnamoorthy before the Judicial Magistrate No.1. Thanjavur. During the pendency of the said case before the trial Court. V.S.Krishnamoorthy, the accused/respondent filed a petition under Section 309 Cr.P.C. praying for the stay of the trial of the case and postpone the case from time to time till the adjudication of the civil suit which he filed against the complainant, the petitioner herein.The petitioner/complainant by way of challenging the order of the sessions Court, filed this petition under Section 482, Cr.P.C.""The complainant is a wholesale proprietor concern dealing in handloom lungies. The accused is doing textile business. the accused defaulted to pay and discharge the credit bills. The unpaid bills accumulated following continuous default in payment by the accused, resulted in huge liability to the tune of Rs.5,24,526. The accused accepted the said liability and agreed to repay the said amount in nine monthly instalments. Accordingly, the accused gave a D.D. for Rs. 1,00,000 towards the first instalment. Thereafter, he issued a cheque for Rs. 1,00,000 dated 15.2.1998 towards the discharge of the second instalment liability. When the cheque was presented, the same was returned as ""exceeds arrangement"". Therefore, the complainant issued a statutory notice on 19.2.1998 which was received by the accused on 21.2.1998. Despite that, no payment nor reply was made. Hence, The complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.""As noted above, while the trial was pending, respondent V.S.Krishnamoorthy filed an application in C.M.P.No.4668 of 1998 under Section 309, Cr.P.C. praying for the stay of the trial and postpone the same from time to time till the adjudication of the civil suit which he filed in O.S.No. 198 of 1998 on the file of the District Munsif, Thanjavur.he accused has filed the suit only after receipt of the statutory notice under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Therefore, there is no valid or justifiable reason either to grant slay or to postpone the case from time to time till the adjudication of the suit.""Challenging these findings in this petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C., Mr.K.V. Sridharan, the learned counsel for the petitioner has made the following submissions:-""The issue in O.S.No.198 of 1998 is whether the defendant is liable to submit the accounts to the plaintiff. The said issue is no! an issue before the criminal Court. Therefore, :he decision in the civil Court will not affect the finding in the criminal Court. As such, the finding that the question of liability in criminal proceedings depends upon the result of the civil suit is clearly erroneous. Moreover, the trial for the offence under Section 138 has to be tried quickly summarily as it is only a summons case. Therefore, when there is no compelling circumstance, the trial Court ought not to have invoked Section 309, Cr.P.C. by slaying the criminal trial and by postponing the same till the disposal of the civil suit.""In reply to these submissions, Mr.R.Jayaseelan, the, learned counsel appearing for the respondent/accused would submit in justification of the impugned orders passed by the trial Court as well as the revisional Court.In State of Rajasthan v. Kalyan Sundaram Cement Industries Ltd, , the Supreme Court has held as follows : It is settled law that pendency of the criminal matters would not be an impediment to proceed with the civil suits. The criminal Court would deal with the offence punishable under the Act. On the other hand, the Courts rarely stay the criminal cases and only when the compelling circumstances require the exercise of their power. The Criminal Court is not competent to decide a dispute of purely civil nature or a question of title involved in any dispute. In view of the position of law that the Criminal Court has no jurisdiction to decide a dispute of civil nature relation to title, the decision of a competent civil court relating to a question of title will be relevant under Section 40 of the Evidence Act. But it is not that all sorts of decisions of the civil court are binding on the criminal Court. Taking a consistent view of the provisions of law including the Sections 40 to 43 of the Evidence Act and the different decisions of the Supreme Court it can be stated by way of summarisation that ordinarily a civil court decision is not binding on the criminal court nor is a Criminal Court decision binding on the civil court. As laid down in the decisions cited supra, there is no difficulty in accepting the principle that the Court has got powers to postpone the trial under Section 309, Cr.P.C. under some compelling circumstances till such period as it may deem fit. In that view of the matter, let us now deal with the facts of this case.The complainant received a cheque for Rs. 1,00,000 dated 15.2.1998 from the accused and the same was presented and got it returned with the endorsement ""funds insufficient"". Therefore, on 19.2.1998 the complainant issued a statutory notice as contemplated under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act demanding the accused to pay the cheque amount within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice. The above issues may not be relevant for the question which may arise for consideration before the criminal Court whether the accused has committed the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Under those circumstances, I am of the view that both the Courts have committed a grave illegality in invoking Section 309, Cr.P.C. by staying or postponing 'the criminal case till the disposal of the civil suit.Though the orders passed by the trial Court and the orders of the revisional Court are normally not interfered with under Section 482, Cr.P.C., especially when the second revision is barred, in the light of the decisions rendered by the Supreme Court in Jitender Kumar v. State of Delhi, 1999 SCC (Cri) 77 and Krishnan v. Krishnaveni, 1997 SCC (Cri) 544, when there is a grave illegality or abuse of process of the court in the orders impugned passed by the revisional Court, it is the duty of the High Court to have it corrected under Section 482 Cr.P.C. I shall make a mention of this. Of late, it is noticed that the criminal Courts, that too in summary cases, dealing with Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, would liberally invoke Section 309, Cr.P.C. by staying or postponing the proceedings before them to indefinite period under the pretext that the similar issues are pending in the civil Courts. KeywordsM/s.

Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and for direction to the consolidation authorities to effect the partition of the share of the petitioner in the land in dispute as well as declaring the sale deed dated 14.11.2005, executed by Uttam Singh (respondent-4) in favour of Veer Singh (respondent-7), as void.The dispute relates to basic consolidation year khatas 51, 100, 132, 175 and 300 of village Tarauli and khata 192 of village Nawabpura, pargana Hasanpur, district Amroha. These khatas consisted plots 2 (area 0.413 hectare), 24 (area 0.312 hectare), 73 (area 0.304 hectare), 77 (area 0.372 hectare), 82 (area 0.304 hectare), 130 (area 0.146 hectare), 168 (area 1.181 hectare), 212 (area 0.125 hectare), 217 (area 0.032 hectare), 229 (area 0.024 hectare), 319 (area 1.206 hectare), 334 (area 0.263 hectare), 421 (area 1.157 hectare) and 425 (area 1.154 hectare) (total 14 plots area 6.993 hectare). In basic consolidation records, name of Veer Singh (respondent-7) was recorded over the land in dispute, along with other co-sharers. The petitioner did not dispute shares of other co-sharers, during consolidation operation.Archna (the petitioner) filed an objection under Section 9 (2) of the Act, on 08.12.2008, for deleting the name of Veer Singh from the land in dispute and recording her name along with Uttam Singh, Bhanu Pratap Singh and Shashi Bhushan Singh (respondents-4 to 6), claiming herself to be a co-parcener of 1/4 share in the land in dispute.  the land in dispute was ancestral property, coming from the time of her grand father, Hardeo Singh. After the death of Hardeo Singh, it was inherited by his sons, Khajan Singh and Uttam Singh and their sons, who formed Joint Hindu Family governed by Mitakshara Hindu Law, of which Uttam Singh was 'Karta', who acted as such up to 1989. Hindu Succession Act, 1956 was amended by Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, w.e.f. 20.12.2004. By virtue of Section 6 of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended), the petitioner has become co-parcener along with her father and brothers (respondents-4 to 6). Under the law, Joint Hindu Family Property is a trust for the benefits of the members, living and to be born. subject ""rights in or over land, and land tenures"" is mentioned in Entry-18 of List-II-State List which includes right of inheritance and there is no overlapping of the subjects between Entry-18 of List-II-State List and Entry-5 of List-III-Concurrent List. Under Article 246 (3) of the Constitution, State Legislature alone has jurisdiction to make law in respect of rights in or over land, and land tenures including right of inheritance. Subject ""succession"" mentioned in Entry-5 of List III-Concurrent List has a limited application as provided under Section 14 of Hindu Succession Act, 1956. Even if it is treated that subject ""succession"" is falling under Entry-5 of List-III-Concurrent List, assent of President of India has been obtained in respect of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 as such in case of repugnancy also, U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 will prevail over Hindu Succession Act, 1956 under Article 254 (2) of the Constitution. Supreme Court in Rajiv Sarin v. State of Uttarakhand, AIR 2011 SC 3081 has held that the assent of the President under Article 254(2) of the Constitution is not a matter of idle formality. The right of transfer of each member of the joint Hindu family of his interest in bhumidhari land is controlled only by Section 152 of the Act and by no other restriction. The provisions of Hindu law relating to restriction on transfer of coparcenary land, e.g., existence of legal necessity, do not apply.In Parshanti v. Dy. Director of Consolidation, AIR 1999 SC 1567, it has been held that a Hindu widow, who after the death of her husband remarries another person, cannot lay a claim to the property of her son through the first marriage in agricultural land in the general law under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 as the provisions of Section 171(b) of the U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951,being a special Act, are applicable.As held above, subject ""rights in or over land, and land tenures"" is mentioned in Entry-18 of List-II-State List which includes right of inheritance and there is no overlapping of the subjects between Entry-18 of List-II-State List and Entry-5 of List-III-Concurrent List. Under Article 246 (3) of the Constitution, State Legislature alone has jurisdiction to make law in respect of rights in or over land, and land tenures including right of inheritance. Subject ""succession"" mentioned in Entry-5 of List III-Concurrent List has a limited application as provided under Section 14 of Hindu Succession Act, 1956. Even if it is treated that subject ""succession"" is falling under Entry-5 of List-III-Concurrent List, assent of President of India has been obtained in respect of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 as such in case of repugnancy also, U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 will prevail over Hindu Succession Act, 1956 under Article 254 (2) of the Constitution. Supreme Court in Rajiv Sarin v. State of Uttarakhand, AIR 2011 SC 3081 has held that the assent of the President under Article 254(2) of the Constitution is not a matter of idle formality. The question arises as to whether Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 was enacted in exercise of powers under Article 253? In order to appreciate aforesaid arguments, aims and object as given by Parliament for enactment of Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 is quoted below:-Hindu Succession (Amendment ) Act 2005 [ No. 39 of 2005] [September 5, 2005] An Act further to amend the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 Be it enacted by Parliament in the Fifty-sixth Year of the Republic of India as follows:-Prefatory Note-Statement of Objects and Reasons.- The Hindu Succession Act, 1956 has amended and codified the law relating to intestate succession among Hindus. The Act brought about changes in the law of succession among Hindus and gave rights which were till then unknown in relation to women's property.The counsel for the petitioner also relied upon the judgments of Delhi High Court in Smt. Mukesh and others Vs. Sri Bharat Singh, (2008) 149 DLT 114 and Karnataka High Court in Pushpalatha Vs. S.V. Padma, AIR 2010 Kar 124, in which provision of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended in 2005) has been applied in agricultural land also. For the reasons given above, I respectfully disagree with the view taken in the above cases. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that due to Section 4 (2) of Hindu Succession Act, 1956, this Court in Jata Shankar Vs. Ram Awalamb, AIR 1969, All 526 (F.B.), Uma Shankar Vs. D.D.C. And others, AIR 1979, All 407 (D.B.), Writ Petition No. 4226 of 1967, Mohd. Sohrab Khan Vs. D.D.C. And others decided on 02.12.1969 and Writ Petition No. 6177 of 2009, Ram Kumar Vs. A.D.J. And others decided on 23.8.2012, it has been held that the provisions of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 has no application on agricultural land. Now Section 4 (2) has been deleted. As held above Section 4(2) of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 was nothing to do with the applicability of the Act. As such the argument of the counsel for the petitioner will not be improved.KeyboardsVeer Singh ,Nawabpura, pargana Hasanpur, Archna, Uttam Singh, Bhanu Pratap Singh , Shashi Bhushan Singh , Hardeo Singh, Khajan Singh , Hindu Succession Act, Section 6 ,U.P.

It is also possible to consider whether the  accused, who had not faced trial, can seek the remedy available under Section 239 Cr P.C. for an order  of discharge. In cases taken cognizance otherwise than on the basis of police report, the Court can also  examine the possibility of the accused approaching the trial Court itself under 8.245 Cr.P.C. as well. In Chellappan Pillai v State of Kerala 1992 (1) KLT 609 another Division Bench of this Court, however,  held that acquittal of a co-accused in a prior trial does not mean that the absconding suspect who is  subsequently tried is also entitled to an acquittal. In the order of reference detailed is made to some of  the decisions of the apex court and a few rendered by this Court and observed that it is desirable to lay  down sufficient guidelines by a Full Bench so as to resolve the issue. Lawyers for Arun Kumar, Sanal Kumar, P.K. Ashokan, Sunny Mathew, Section U. Nazar, M. Santhosh  Kumar, V.R. Rajgopal, Ramesh Chander, C.M. Kammappu, Babu, K.P. Mujeeb, S. Harikrishnan and  S. Gopakumaran Nair argued on behalf of the petitioners and the learned Director General of  Prosecution. The Director General of Prosecution Sri. Madhavan Nambiar, on the other hand, contended that the  judgment in the case of a co-accused is not judgment relevant within the meaning of Sections 41 to 43  of the Evidence Act. He also contended that any document, unless could be translated into the form of  legal unimpeachable evidence, cannot be looked into to quash further proceeding which will be in effect  barring the very trial. The Rule of estoppel is only a ""rule of evidence"" and the contention if any based  on rule of estoppel has to be at the stage of trial only. Section 561-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was amended to read as Section 482 Cr.P.C.  in 1973. Both sides cited various authorities in support of their contentions. The history of the legislation  behind the incorporation of a provision like this one is described below. 10. The inherent power of the  High Court to do real and substantial justice between the parties was statutorily recognized by Section  561-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. In Emperor v. Sukh Dev 1929 Lahore, 705 it was held  that the inherent power cannot be exercised for doing act which would conflict with any of the  provisions of law or general principles of criminal jurisprudence. Section 561-A was a sort of reminder to the High Court that they were not the Courts of law, but also  the courts of justice. In Rule P. Kapur v. State of Punjab it was held by the apex court that Section 561  A Cr.P.C. cannot be exercised in regard to matters specifically covered by the other provisions of the  Code.These include cases where there is no legal evidence in support of the case or the evidence adduced  clearly or manifestly fails to support the charge. The High Court was justified in refusing to quash the  proceedings, which had reached the criminal court, it was held. Broadly stated that is the nature and  scope of the inherent jurisdiction ofthe High Court under Section 561-A in the matter of quashing  criminal proceedings, and that is theeffect of the judicial decisions on the point. In that case, it was  found that the allegation made against the petitioner in the F.I.R. constituted certain offences against  him and there was no legalbar to institution of the proceedings commenced on that F.I.R. or their  continuance. In Dr. Raghubir Saran v. State of Bihar the apex court again held that the High Court has inherent power  under Section 561-A to expunge objectionable remarks in judgment or order of.n subordinate court  against stranger, after it has become final. In Dr. Raghubir Saran v. State of Bihar the apex court again  held that the High Court has the power under Section 561-A to expunge objectionable remarks in  judgment or order of subordinate court against stranger. This is soon the basis that the court cannot be  utilised for any oblique purpose and where in the opinion ofthe court chances of an ultimate conviction  are bleak, no useful purpose is likely to beserved by allowing a criminal prosecution to continue. In State of Karnataka v L. Muniswamy Karnataka the apex court held that the High Court can under its inherent power quash proceedings pending before the Sessions Judge on ground of insufficiency of evidence. It was further held that a court proceeding ought not to be permitted to degenerate into a  weapon of harassment or prosecution. Considerations justifying the exercise of inherent powers for  securing the ends of justice naturally vary from case to case and a jurisdiction as wholesome as the one  conferred by Section 482 should not be encased within the strait-jacket of a rigid formula. The power under Section 482Cr.P.C. to quash a complaint should not be exercised where allegations  prima facie constituting the offence alleged in the complaint. In Chand Dhawan v Jawaharlal 1992 SCC  (Crl.) 636 the Apex Court held that the High Court was not justified in quashing the complaint and the  criminal proceedings on the ground of abuse of process of court. The High Court in its revisional  jurisdiction would not be justified in relying upon documents other than those referred to in Section 239  and 240 Cr-PC. In State of Bihar v. Rajendra Agrawalla 1996 SCC (Crl.) 628 it was held by the Supreme Court that the  inherent power of the court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. should be very sparingly and cautiously used  only when the court comes to the conclusion that there would be manifest injustice if such power is not  exercised. The High Court quashed the cognizance taken by the Magistrate. Section 227 Cr.PC. The Supreme Court of India has ruled that the Magistrate can discharge the accused  at any stage of the trial if he considers the charge to be ""roundless"". Satish Mehra v. Delhi  Administration was a case where the Sessions Judge framed charges on the first charge was that the  appellant had outraged the modesty of his minor daughter. Section 228 contemplates the stage after the  case survives the stage envisaged in the former section. In Dinesh Dutt Joshi v. State of Rajasthan it was held that Section 482 Cr.PC has been embodied to  cover the lacunae which are sometimes found in the procedural law. However, this extraordinary power  is to be used in extraordinary cases -- Maxims-- ""quando lex aliquid alicui concedit"" and ""ex debito  iustitiae"". That was a case where on receipt of a complaint, a charge-sheet was submitted by the police  against the respondents alleging commission of offences punishable under Sections 465, 468, 471 and  420 r/w Section 120-B IPC. In State of Karnataka v. M. Devendrappa it was held that the power under Section 482 Cr.PC should be exercised ex debito justitiae to prevent abuse of process of court, but it  should not be exercised to Moosa vs Sub Inspector Of Police on 23 December, 2005. In B.S. Joshi v. State of Haryana, the Apex Court held that the power under Section 482 Cr.PC. has no  limits and therefore, utmost care and caution are required while invoking such powers. In state of M.R v. Awadh Kishore Gupta. 2004 (1) KLT (SC)(SN) 35: (2004) SCC (Crl.) 353 it was held that quashing  of investigation and subsequent proceedings by appreciating evidence is not proper. In para 5 of the judgment in Rule P. Kapur v. State of Punjab, it was held that ""exercise of power under  Section 482 of the Code is the exception and not the rule"". The section does not confer any new powers  on the High Court but saves the inherent power which the Court possessed before the enactment of the  code. Dr. Sanjay Singh and Mr. Amita Kulkarni were implicated as accused but were discharged by an order  passed by the State before the High Court. Syed Modi was shot dead by Amar Bahadur Singh and two  others at Lucknow when he was coming back after his badminton practice. It was held that issue of process under Section 204 Cr P.C. is a preliminary step in trial contemplated  in Chapter 20 (Sections 251 to 259) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and is therefore an interlocutory  order which cannot be reviewed, reconsidered or re-called by the Magistrate. The court has also upheld  the interpretation of the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in State of Haryana v Bhajan Lal,  which states that when a prima facie offence under Sections 354 and 509 IPC was made, the High Court  was not justified in quashing the case. The Supreme Court of India has ruled that no hard and fast rule can be laid down when facts are  incomplete and hazy. Apex Court also cannot embark upon enquiry as regards the reliability of the  evidence and sustainability of the accusation. Section 482 Cr P.C. of the present Code has no limit but  the exercise of which is to prevent abuse of process of Court. An acquittal of an accused in a trial under Section 19 (f) Arms Act instant amount to a finding that the  prosecution had failed to establish the possession of certain Moosa vs Sub Inspector Of Police on 23  December, 2005. In Pritam Singh v. The State of Punjab the Apex Court considered the ambit of Section  403 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In Sheo Nandan v. The State the principle of res judicata and  its application are stated thus:""Where after several persons who were tried for the offence of dacoity  were acquitted with a finding that the currency notes recovered from one of the accused were not looted  property but belonged to him, two more persons who were concerned in the same dacoity and who were  absconding were arrested and tried for the same offence separately. Section 403 Cr.P.C. 1898 does not preclude the applicability of this rule, Supreme Court has held. The  rule of issue estoppel in Pritam Singh's case relates only to admissibility of evidence which is not likely  to upset a finding of fact by a competent court. The Court of Appeal has upheld the acquittal of Kharkan  v. State of U.P. 1965 (1-Crl.L.J. 116) by ruling that the applicability of Section 403 was considered by  the apex court. The plea will arise when a person is tried again for the same offence under conditions  attracting Section 236 or Section 237 of the Indian Penal Code. Section 403 of Cr P.C. governs the entire principle of autrefois acquit and Autrefois convict. In State of  Andhra Pradesh v Kokkili agada Meerayya the principle of ""Issue estoppel"" in criminal cases was  applied. India's Supreme Court has upheld a ruling of the High Court of Australia that an order of conviction or  acquittal does not prohibit a trial for any other offence. The Supreme Court of India has ruled that a  finding of fact must be determined at a later stage of a case. Issue estoppel arises only if the earlier as  well as the subsequent proceedings were criminal prosecutions, The Victims brought an action claiming  damages against the Water Authority, contractors and consultants. Reference was made to Connelly v. Director of Public Prosecutions LR (1964) AC 1254 decided by the  House of Lords. The Apex Court observed that there was some difference of opinion among the Law  Lords regarding the applicability of the rule to criminal trials in the English Courts.A three Judges' Bench of the Supreme Court in Kharkan v. state of Uttar Pradesh considered the  question of whether acquittal in two different trials for distinct offences is a bar to convict in the other  case. It was held that the reasoning of judgment of acquittal not admissible as evidence. The State would  contend that the judgment is relevant within the meaning of Sections 40 to 43 of the Evidence Act. Under Sections 40 to 43 of the Evidence Act, Section 403 Cr.P.C. would bar a second trial if it is shown  that the petitioner had been tried earlier. It was also noticed that the sessions trial which ended in  acquittal was connected with a dacoity and the acquittal on the ground that the identification witness  did not have sufficient opportunity to recognise the evidence. In Raja Ram v M.P. 1994 SCC (Crl.) 573 it was held that in the case of non appealing defendants, the  benefit of altered conviction and sentence must also be made available to such non-appealing accused.  The principle of Falsus in uno falsus in omnibus was not applicable in India. In Raju Rai v. State of Bihar, the Supreme Court held that acquittal of co-accused does not per se entitle  others to acquittal. The court has duty in suit cases to separate grain from chaff as it is its duty to separate  wheat from the chaff. Arun Kumar's acquittal will not preclude the trial of the case for the mere reason  that his co-accused were acquitted. Rule of estoppel as held by the Apex Court is a rule of admissibility  of evidence, which does not bar the trial as such. The High Court's powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure are sweeping and  awesome, writes Mr Justice Rangam Thakkar. But such powers can only be invoked in exceptional and  rare cases, he writes, and cannot be invoked as a matter of course. Judgment of acquittal of a co-accused in a criminal trial is not admissible under Sections 40\r to 43 of  the Evidence Act. The High Court has to consider in each case whether the powers under Section 482  of the Code of Criminal Procedure apply. The Office of the President of India will take steps for posting  the above cases before appropriate Bench to expedite the disposal of them. We concur completely with  the legal position summarised by my learned brother in Para 53 and directions in para 54. Keywords: Balakrishna Pillai v.

Jhanji, Act. C.J. This Criminal Reference emanates from proceedings under Section 488 read with Section 489  of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Their mother, Nahida, was divorced by the respondent  during the pendency of the proceedings. It appears that, on an application being made before  the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Srinagar, under Section 488 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure by one Nahida, wife; and Lubna Mehraj and Hena Mehraj, two daughters, i.e.,  Petitioners 1 and 2; and petitioner No. 3, Owais Mehraj, son, of the respondent, the learned  Magistrate, in terms of his order dated 20th August, 1997, granted Rs. 500 each as maintenance  in favour of the three petitioners. The petitioners had no other source of income to meet their  day to day expenses.  They had attained the age of majority and were not entitled to claim maintenance as a matter  of right. This preliminary objection was over-ruled by the learned Magistrate vide order dated  10th October 2000. The compensation will be payable from the date of order of the court below,  i.e. from 4.9.2002. Criminal Reference on Mala Sidiq v. Dilshada Banoo, Cr. M.P. No. 99/2003came up for  hearing before the learned Single Judge of the Kashmir High Court, Srinagar, on 21st August,  2003. Learned counsel for the petitioners stated that a recent judgment by one of the learned  Judges of this Court required reconsideration as the judgments of the Supreme Court had been  wrongly interpreted. Learned counsel for the respondent, Shri G. A. Lone, citing a recent  judgment passed by one of the learned Single Judges of this Court in ""Mala Sidiq v. Dilshada  Banoo, Cr. Ref. No. 26/2002 decided on 29th May, 2003, contended that a major daughter was  not entitled to maintenance under Section 488 Cr. P. C. In this Reference, we examine the meaning and import of various words and phrases occurring  and employed in Section 488 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to canvass for and against the  question of whether an unmarried major daughter is entitled to claim maintenance from her  father. The learned counsel on both sides of the argument have confined their arguments only  in relation to the question. It would be advantageous to quote herein below Section 488 of the  Code, as amended by the Amending Act of 1998: However, clauses (b) and (c) of Sub-section  (1) of Section 488, concerning the children, apparently, fall short of the indications that are  gathered from the caption. A man is deemed unfit to maintain his wife, or his legitimate or illegitimate minor child,  whether married or not, if they are unable to maintain themselves. A Magistrate of the first  class may order such person to make a monthly allowance for the maintenance of his wife or  such child (not being a married daughter) who has attained majority. Section 488 Cr. P.C. provides that a 'minor' means a person who, under the provisions of the  Majority Act, Samvat 1977 is deemed not to have attained his majority. The meaning assigned to the word 'neglect', as it occurs in the aforesaid provision, is disregard; pay little or no respect  or attention to; slight, leave unnoticed; fail to give proper care of; leave unattended to or  uncared for; perform, leave undone, be remiss about; fail through carelessness or negligence to  do, omit doing; cause (something) to be neglected (The New Shorter Oxford English  Dictionary, Vol. 2, 1993 Edition). Therefore, the word 'neglect' not only means a tacit non performance of such a duty by father but also embraces the duty of a father to maintain his  unmarried major daughter. A major unmarried daughter of a married father is not entitled to  the ceiling of maintenance provided under Section 488 Cr.P.C. C. Clause (b) of the Code  includes all minor children, whether married or not, Clause (c) is not that wide in its texture.  Two ancillary questions arise for consideration, therefore, as to whether a major unmarried child is totally excluded from the purview of this section and if not, what circumstances she is  entitled to claim maintenance. When a child suffers neglect in context of all these basic needs, she is sure to be emotionally  hit, reflecting adversely upon her mental faculty and that is mental injury. Mr G. A. Lone,  opposing this Reference, submitted that mental injury means nothing more than a mental  infirmity by reason of which a female child may not be able to maintain herself. ""Mental injury"" is relatable to the behavioural changes caused due to emotional disturbances  in a child. When parental actions are disruptive or disturbing in relationship, children are the  first to suffer, and suffer the worst. If the child happens to be accustomed to father's affection,  care and concern, separation from the parent plays havoc with the mental process of the child.  Emotional child abuse is also known as verbal child abuse, psychological child abuse or  ""mental injury of a child"". A child suffering from mental injury can be as normal as any other  person. It may, however, impair the cognitive abilities and adversely affect the personality  development of the child. According to the learned counsel for the respondent, the phrase ""where such child is by reason  of introduces a conditional clause to the factum of inability to maintain. Clause in question  starts with the word ""where"", occurring in the phrase ""by reason of mental injury"". The  proposition propounded by learned counsel for the respondent ex-facie is misconceived. Clause  does not relate to any place, position or direction nor is the provision interrogatory. Rule of  construction of statutory language is that words and phrases are firstly to be construed in their  ordinary meaning. ""Where"" does not mean ""if"", as it occurs in the clause, which means ""in a  situation in which"" which is equivalent to ""In the circumstances in which"". Reading Clause (c)  thus in just a position with Sub-section (1), the provision does not admit of a construction that  such a child has to show the reasons for inability to maintain herself. The emphasis is on the  phrase ""neglect and refusal to maintain"" and the inability of the child to maintain itself. The provision is aimed at not only remedying the neglect and refusal to maintain, as settled  by the Supreme Court, but also at preventing the ill and evil consequences of such child neglect. Clause (c), like other clauses, has added new dimensions to the welfare enactments  as are contained in Chapter XXXVI of the Code of 1989 (1933 AD). The need, therefore, is  to construe Clause (c) of Sub-section (1) of Section 488 Cr. P. C liberally to fructify the  object underlying the provision. By providing a simple, speedy but limited relief they seek to  ensure that the neglected wife and children are not left beggard and destituted on the scrap heap of society and thereby driven to a life of vagrancy, immorality and crime. Reference to Section 488 Cr. P. C of the Sri Pratap Jammu and Kashmir Laws (Consolidation  Act) has been filed in the Supreme Court of India. Lawyers for the petitioners argued that under Muslim Personal Law daughters are legally entitled to be maintained by the father till  they get married. Dr. Afzal Wani (1995 Edn) cited and relied upon The Hedaya, a  commentary on the Islamic laws translated by Charles Hamilton (Reprint Edition 1994). In  support of this submission, the learned counsel, besides referring to the relevant passages  from Summarised Sahi A1-Bukhari, (a compilation of holy sayings of the holy Prophet)  translated by Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan, Islamic University, (Kingdon of Saudi Arabia);  the Islamic Law on Maintenance of Women, Children, Parents and other relatives by Dr. M.  Afzal Wani (1995 Edn); Tahir Mahmood's Book, the Muslim Law of India (Third Edition  2002); The Hedaya, a commentary on the Islamic laws translated by Charles Hamilton  (Reprint Edition 1994), cited and relied upon Yanunabai v. Anantrao, AIR 1988 SC 644;  Jagdesh Jugtawat v. Manju Lata, (2002) 5, SCC 422; Fazi v. All Mohd 1975 Cri L.J. 1228:1974(V) J&K LR730 and Noor Saba Khatoon v. Mohd. Quasim, AIR 1997 SC 3280. In Yamunabai v. Anantrao (supra) the attempt to exclude altogether the personal law  applicable to the parties from consideration is improper. The issue whether the section is attracted or not cannot be answered except by reference to the appropriate law governing the  parties. The Supreme Court of India quoted a passage from the Book Statute Law relating to Muslims in India (1995 Edn.) in relation to Section 125 Cr. P. C. written by Professor Tahir  Mahamood. The relevant portion of the said passage, as quoted in the judgment is reproduced  here under:. ""By Muslim Law maintenance (nafaqa) is a birth right of children and an  absolute liability of the father"". Section 3(1)(b) of the 1986 Act does not in any way affect the  rights of the minor children of divorced Muslim parents to claim maintenance from their  father under Section 125 Cr. P. C. The obligation of a Muslim father to maintain his minor  children, unable to maintain themselves, till they attain majority and in case of females till  they get married, is absolute. In this view of the matter, not only the Muslim Personal Law, but also the provisions of  Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act can be read together with the provisions of Section  488 Cr. P. C. The Mohammedan Law confers a right of maintenance during the period of  Iddat, according to the Sri Pratap Jammu and Kashmir Laws Consolidation Act, 1977. The  Division Bench of this Court held as under: ""We are, however, unable to agree with this  contention"". The Division Bench of this Court has noticed Clause (d) of Sub-section (1) of Section 4 of  the Consolidation Act of 1920 AD. It is thus seen that if the personal law confers the right to  maintenance then such a legal right can be enforced under Section 488 of the Code of  Criminal Procedure. The argument of learned counsel for the respondent in this behalf is,  accordingly, answered and over-ruled. In the case, Fazi v. Ali Mohd (supra), the Division  Bench of this Court has noticed Clause (d) of Sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Consolidation Act of 1920 AD and applied personal law by force of the said provision of Consolidation Act. The learned Single Judge observed that in case of such a Hindu girl, the  position in respect of her right of maintenance will remain the same. In view of the provisions  of Section 7, the Family Court possessed jurisdiction to grant maintenance under Civil Law  as well as under Section 125 Cr. P.C. corresponding to Section 488 of J&K Cr.P.C., he said.Jagdish Jugtawat v. Manju Lata does not refer to the ""Order for maintenance of wife, children  and parents"" as contained in Section 125 of the Central Procedure Code. Clause (f) under the Explanation in Section 7 of the Family Courts Act has reference to such proceedings as may  be initiated for grant of maintenance by any person by resort to civil law, including Section  20(3) of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act or Section 3(1)(b) of Muslim women's  protection of rights on divorce. A plain reading of Clause (a) of Sub-section (2) of Section 7  of the Family Courts Act reveals that a Family Court, though a Civil Court, is conferred with  Magisterial powers. Chapter IX (relating to order for maintenance of wife, children and  parents) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, reads as follows: ""(2) Subject to the other  provisions of this Act,. A Family Court shall have and exercise."" Section 488 Cr. P.C. of Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 to be  applied to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. Mohammedans Clause (d) of Sub-section (1) of  Section 4 of Consolidation Act is quoted in the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court  in Fazi v. AH Mohd (supra). Civil and Criminal Courts. Jagdesh Jugtawat Y Manju. Therefore, following the ratio of the  judgments of the Supreme Court in Noor Saba Khatoon v. Mohd Quasim and Jagdesh  Jugtawat Y Manju Lata (supra) as also the judgment of this Court in Fazi v. Ali Mohd (supra), Personal Laws can be and have to be read together with the provision of Section 488  of the Code of Criminal Procedure in Jammu and Kashmir State. The learned Chief Judicial  Magistrate has ordered enhancement of maintenance from Rs. 500 to Rs. 1500 in respect of  the two daughters and Uvais Mehraj's son, among others. Learned counsel for the respondent  argued that the proposal for enhancement made by the learned Sessions Judge is unwarranted,  unreasonable and excessive. One of the daughters of the respondent Lubna Mehraj is undergoing B.D. The other daughter  was undergoing three years' diploma in Engineering and Electronics. Any new circumstance  that has come into existence after order dated 4th September, 2000 can be brought to the  notice of the learned Magistrate. The learned Magistrate enhanced the maintenance in respect  of each of the petitioners. The respondent has withdrawn an aggregate amount of Rs.  3,78,600 from his G. P. Fund account. He also admitted that he did not pay any admission fee  to petitioners 1 and 2. A government servant under the relevant rules is under a mandate to contribute towards his G. P. Fund account. The learned Sessions Judge in his order of Reference has observed that  the respondent could approach the Drawing and Disbursing Officer for reducing the rate of  deductions being made from his pay. We feel that the learned Magistrate has taken  reasonable care of every aspect of the matter. The Reference is, accordingly, answered and the trial court records be returned to the  concerned courts forthwith. Petitioners are free to approach the learned Chief Judge as and  when they feel any change in the circumstances, necessitating further enhancement in the  magistrate's maintenance allowance, should it be necessary.KEYWORDS: Nahida Chief Judicial Magistrate, Srinagar, Lubna Mehraj and Hena Mehraj, Owais Mehraj, Mala Sidiq v.

47,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/67965481/,67965481,Vineeta Sharma vs Rakesh Sharma on 11 August 2020,2020,,Supreme Court of India,,"82058, 1787225",,,1,1,,"Supreme Court of India Vineeta Sharma vs Rakesh Sharma on 11 August, 2020 Author: Arun Mishra JUDGMENT: ARUN MISHRA, J. The interpretation of section 6 of the signature Not Verified Hindu, 1956, as amended by Narendra Prasad has also been referred for hearing. The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act,  2005, has been referred to a larger Bench in view of conflicting verdicts of this Court. Section 6, as amended by the Act of 2005, is deemed to be there since 17.6.1956. The High  Court held that the partition and unregistered partition deeds are excluded from the definition  of 'partition' used in the Explanation to amended Section 6(5). Any coparcener, including a daughter, can claim a partition in thecoparcenary property. The  registration requirement is inapplicable to partition of property by operation of law, which  has to be given full effect. Section 6 is not in operation when both the coparceners and his  daughter were alive. Daughters have been given the right of a coparcener, to bring equality with sons. The  conferment of coparcenary status on daughters would not affect any partition that may have  happened before 20.12.2004. They were unable to inherit ancestral property like sons/male counterparts. The death of any coparcener does not bring to an end his coparcenary rights. Coparcenary  interest becomes definite only when a partition is effected. New coparceners can be added on  account of birth till the time an actual partition takes place, as in the case of Vineeta Sharma vs Rakesh Sharma. There is no conflict between the decisions in Prakash v. Phulavati and Danamma v.Suman  (supra) and the provisions of section 6(5) of the Amendment Act, says Shri R.  Venkataramani, learned senior counsel/amicus curiae. A Hindu coparcenary is said to have seven essential characteristics, which include that the  interest of a deceased member survives on his death and merges with that of a living  coparcener. By birth and adoption, a male becomes a coparener in Hindu law. Parliament has  not intended to scramble the unscrambled egg or to resurrect the past. The scheme of section  6 is future and forward-looking, and it has to be interpreted in such a manner that its  relevance is not diluted. Any other interpretation would cause unjust consequences. Section  6(1)(a) declares a daughter to be a coparcener by birth. By the declaration, a daughter is  included in coparcenary. The future perfect tense indicates that an action will have to be  completed (finished or perfected) at some point in the future. The provision was not in force before the Act of 1956 was enacted. The House of Lords  Committee on Rules and Privileges has concluded that it was not necessary for a partition to  be registered under section 6(1)(a) of the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Northern Ireland)  Act 2005, w.e.f 9.9.2005. Section 6(1) indicates that the daughter of a coparcener shall by  birth, have the same rights and be subject to the same liabilities. The word ""shall"" indicates the due status of the daughter is created only for the future. Partition could be in the form of a  memorandum of partition, or it could also be made orally. Shri Sridhar Potaraju argued that the decision in Prakash v Phulavati adopted the correct  interpretation of the provision. He relied upon Surjit Lal Chhabda v Commissioner of Income  Tax, (1976) 3 SCC 142. ""Daughter of a coparcener"" means the daughter of an alive person  and has the status of coparcener on the date of commencement of the Amendment Act. The  mere filing of a suit for partition is sufficient to effect a partition. Section 6, as amended, is not applicable in the case of a daughter whose father is not alive at  the time of introduction of provisions of section 6. The Central Amendment has not made a  distinction based on the daughter's marital status expressly but has made it evident by the use  of the term 'joint Hindu family'. Uppaluri Hari Narayana & Ors, the only step required to be taken is to apportion the shares  by metes and bounds in terms of the preliminary decree which was passed. The only step  required to be taken is to apportion the shares by metes and bounds in terms of the  preliminary decree which was passed. Even in a case of adoption, the past transactions are  saved while applying the theory of relation back as laid down in Sripad Gajanan Suthankar v. Dattaram Kashinath Suthanka & Ors. Shri Amit Pai, learned counsel, urged that section 6 includes all living daughters of  coparceners, irrespective of whether they are deceased or alive at the commencement of the  2005 Amendment. The decision in Prakash v Phulavati, laying down that section 6 applies in  case of living daughters of a living coparcener, is arbitrary and non?est in the eye of law.  Both sons and daughters of coparceners are conferred the right of becoming Coparcener by  birth. The Hindu branch of dharma is influenced by the theological tenets of the Vedic Aryans.  There are two main schools of Hindu law, i.e., Mitakshara and Dayabhaga. Benares, Mithila,  Dravida, and Maharashtra denote old names of the territories. Mitakshara law applies to most  parts of India except Bengal. Certain areas in Southern India are Marumakkatayam,  Aliyasantana and Nambudiri systems of law. Coparcenary property is the one which is  inherited by a Hindu from his father, grandfather, or great grandfather. A Hindu joint family consists of male members descended lineally from a common male  ancestor. Coparcener heirs get right by birth. Another method to be a coparcener is by way of  adoption. The interest in coparcenary is fluctuating by death and birth in the family. Coparcenary property comes to the hands of a 'single person' temporarily, it would be treated  as his property, but once a son is born, coparcenary would revive in terms of the Mitakshara  law. In Sheela Devi v Lal Chand, (2006) 8 SCC 581, it was observed thus expressed.  According to the Mitakshara School of Hindu Law all property of a Hindu joint family is held  in collective ownership by all the coparceners. A coparcenary under the law cannot arise by  Act of parties except in so far as on adoption the adopted son becomes a coparcener with his  adoptive father. The property of a family, with its accretions, is owned by the family, as a corporate body, and  one or more branches of that family. Essential characteristics of coparcenary were analysed in  Controller of Estate Duty v. Alladi Kuppuswamy, (supra). A Hindu coparcenary has six essential characteristics, namely that the lineal male descendants up to the third generation  acquire an independent right of ownership by birth. Like other coparceners she has a fluctuating interest in the property which may be increased or decreased by deaths or  additions in the family. A widow of a Hindu coparcener is invested with the same interest which her husband had at  his death in the property of the coparcenary. But she does not acquire the right over other  coparceners' property that her husband could have had under Hindu law. Coparcenary cannot be created by agreement of parties except in the case of reunion.  Coparcenary is narrower body than joint family. Hindu law does not recognize some of the  members of a joint family belonging to different branches, or even to a single branch, as a  corporate unit. A Hindu joint family is a body of all persons lineally descended from a  common ancestor and includes their wives and unmarried daughters. A Hindu coparcenary is  a much narrower body: it includes only those who acquire by birth an interest in the joint or  coparcenary property. A Hindu coparcenary is a male member of a joint family and his sons, grandsons and great grandsons are coparcenarian. Every coparcener takes a defined share in the property and he is  the owner of that share. It is a narrower body than the joint family. The Supreme Court of India has upheld the validity of Section 6 of the Act which gives a  female heir an interest in the property of a male member of the family, but it cannot be  treated as having ceased to be a member membership without her volition. In the instant case  the theory that there was a family settlement is not pressed before us, as there was no action  taken by either of the two women concerned in the case. It should, therefore, be held that not withstanding the death of Sham Rao the remaining members of the Dayabhaga family continued to hold the family properties together. The essential feature is aggregate ownership, i.e., Samudavika Swatwa in coparcenary and  the share keeps on fluctuating. The son of the murdered father acquires by birth or adoption a  vested interest in all coparcenary property whether ancestral or not. If he had not murdered  his father he would have along with his wife succeeded in the matter. But what is the effect  on the succession of the property of the deceased father if he was murdered? The rights of each coparcener until a partition consist in a common possession and common  enjoyment of the coparcenary property. There is a community of interest and unity of  possession between all the members of the family. Even if he becomes afflicted with lunacy,  he does not lose his status as a coparcener. Coparcenary is a narrower body than the joint Hindu family. A coparcener has no definite share in the coparcenary property but he has an  undivided interest in it. We are of the opinion that so long as an ancestral property remains in  the hand of one person, it should be treated as a separate property. The interest of a coparcener is called ""undivided coparcenary interest,"" which remains  undivided as held by the Privy Council in Katama Natchiar v. Srimat Rajah Moottoo Vijaya  Raganadha Bodha Gooroo Swamy, (1863) 9 MIA. A similar view was taken in Thamma  Venkata Subramma (dead) by LR v. Thamnma Ratamma &/rOrs., (1987) 3 SCC 294.In Bhagwant P. Sulakhe v. Digambar Gopal Sulakhe, (1986) 1 SCC 366, a 3?Judge Bench of  this Court held that character of a joint family property does not change with the severance in  the status of the joint family before an actual partition takes place. In Bhagwati Prasad Sah &  Ors. v. Dulhin Rameshwari Kuer & Anr., AIR 1952 SC 72, it was held that once a coparcener  separates himself from other members of the joint family, there is no presumption that the  rest of the coparceners continued to be joint. Mitakshara divides property into two classes - apratibandha daya or unobstructed heritage,  and saprati bandhadaya or obstructed heritage. Property in which a person acquires an interest  by birth is called unobstructed; accrual of right to it is not obstructed by the existence of the  owner. Section 6 of Hindu Succession (Amendment Act, 2005) provides that interest in coparcenary  property shall devolve by testamentary or intestate succession, as the case may be, on a  Hindu Mitakshara coparcener. Any property to which a female Hindu becomes entitled by  virtue of sub-section (1) shall be held by her. The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005  provides that a daughter is allotted the same share in property as is allotted to a son. The pre deceased child of a pre- deceased son or pre-deadly daughter is equally divided between them  and the surviving child of such son or daughter. The Hindu Succession Act, 1956 was passed by the Parliament of India. The Act lays down a  uniform and comprehensive system of inheritance. It does not interfere with the special rights  of those who are members of Hindu Mitakshara coparcenary except to provide rules for  devolution of interest of a deceased male.  Section 6 deals with devolution of interest in coparcenary property of a joint Hindu family  under the Mitakshara law. Explanation 2 disentitled the separated person to make any claim  in case of intestate succession. A daughter is a daughter throughout her life and is treated as a  coparcener in the same manner as a son by birth. Section 6 provided that on death of a male  Hindu, coparcener's interest in Mitakshara coparcenary shall devolve by survivorship upon  the surviving members of the Coparcenary under the uncodified Hindu law. I provided legal  fiction of partition as if it had taken place immediately before his death. There is no dispute that vested rights are not taken away by an enactment which is ex facie  not retrospective. The change of the forum for appeal by enactment may not affect the right  to appeal itself. The concept of retrospective and retroactive statute was stated by this Court  in Darshan Singh etc v Ram Pal Singh & Anr. In Halsburys Laws of England (4th edn., Vol.  44, at paragraph 921) we find the meaning of the term 'retrospective' somewhat unclear.  Courts regard a statute as retrospective if it affects transactions previously entered into or of  other past conduct. Section 6(4) makes a daughter liable in the same manner as that of a son. The daughter,  grand?daughter, or great-granddaughter, as the case may be, is equally bound to follow the  pious obligation under the Hindu Law to discharge any debt. Section 6(1)(a) of the Indian  Human Rights Act provides that a daughter becomes coparcener in the same manner as a son  by birth. The concept of uncodified Hindu law of unobstructed heritage has been given a  concrete underpinnings. Section 6(1) recognises a joint Hindu family governed by Mitakshara  law. Conferral is not based on the death of a father or other. In case living coparcener dies  after 9.9.2005, inheritance is not by survivorship but by succession.The decision in Bireswar Mookerji & v Shib Chunder Roy was relied upon to argue that  adoption is only of a male and not a female. There is no dispute with the proposition that a coparcenary right accrued to males under the prevalent law by birth or adoption, the Court of  Appeal has held. The High Court has held that the requirement of partition being registered  can have no application to statutory notional partition, on the opening of succession as per the  provision of section 6. There is no express provision for giving retrospective effect to the  amended provision nor necessary intendment to that effect. The Court has ruled that the rights under substituted section 6 accrue to living daughters of  living coparceners as on 9-9- 2005 irrespective of when such daughters are born. The Court finds that the attention of this Court was not drawn to the aspect as to how a coparcenary is  created. In Mangammal, the Court opined that Section 29A of the Act was valid regarding  succession by survivorship and provided equal rights to daughters in coparcenary property.  Rights under the amendment are applicable to daughters of living coparceners as on 9-9- 2005 irrespective of when such daughters are born. Section 6 of the Act, as amended, recognises the rights of coparceners of daughters as well  since birth. The section uses the words in the same manner as that of the son. It should be  apparent that both the sons and the daughters of a coparcener have been conferred the right of  becoming coparceners.  There is no dispute that the property which was the subject of a partition suit belongs to joint  family and Gurulingappa Savadi was propositus of the joint family property. In view of our  aforesaid discussion, in the said partition, share will devolve upon the appellants as well.  Since, Arun Kumar will have 1/5th share, it would be divided into five\rshares on partition  i.e. between Defendant 1 Arun Kumar, his wife Defendant 2, his daughters Defendants 3 and  4 and son/plaintiff (Respondent 1). There is a divergence of opinion with respect to the aspect  of the daughter of a living coparcener. The daughter has now become entitled to claim  partition of coparcenary w.e.f. 9.9.2005, which is a vital change brought about by the statute.  After taking a definite share in the property, a coparcener becomes the owner of that share,  and, as such, he can alienate the same by sale or mortgage. Without partition, only undivided share can be sold, the Court of Appeal has ruled. The Court in the abovesaid decision made general observation but was not concerned with the aspect  when the partition was completed. Shares of coparceners can undergo a change in  coparcenary by birth and death, unless and until the final division is made. If a partition does take place between her husband and his sons, she is entitled (except in  SouthernIndia) to receive a share equal to that of a son and to hold and enjoy that share even  from her husband. The intention to separate should not be confused with the change of rights  during the pendency of the suit, which has to be given full effect. A preliminary decree for partition will not amount to a partition unless an actual physical  partition is carried out. The benefit of section 29A could not have been denied to women  whose daughters were entitled under section 29B. A preliminary decree does not bring about  the final partition, however, In Prema v. Nanje Gowda, AIR 2011 SC 2077, the Court opined  that since the final decree had not been passed, clause (iv) to Section 29-A was not attracted  in the present case and the respondent-daughters were entitled to their share in the family property. The amendment was made by the State of Karnataka in the Hindu Succession Act,  1956 The partition suit is required to be decided in stages, the same can be regarded as fully and  completely decided only when the final decree is passed. If in the interregnum any party to  the partition suit dies, then his/her share is required to be allotted to the surviving parties. The  Court is duty-bound to decide the matter and pass final decree keeping in view of changed  scenario. In a partition suit, preliminary decree cannot be varied in the final decree proceedings despite  amendment of the law governing the parties. A preliminary decree can be amended to fully  recognise the rights of a daughter. Vineeta Sharma vs Rakesh Sharma on 11 August, 2020.  There is no code of civil procedure which prohibits the passing of more than one preliminary  decree, the court has ruled. A second decree could be passed in partition suits by which  shares allotted in the preliminary decree already passed can be amended, it has been ruled. In Phool chand, the Court said: It is clear that the High Court was clearly in error in not  properly appreciating the scope of Order XX Rule 18 of CPC (Partition of immovable  property). Partition is a redistribution or adjustment of pre-existing rights, among co owners/coparceners. The effect of such division is that the joint ownership is terminated and  the respective shares vest in them. A preliminary decree in a partition suit does not have the  effect of disposing of the suit. In Laxmi Narayan Guin & Ors. v Niranjan Modak, (1985) 1 SCC 270, it was laid down that a  change in law during the pendency of an appeal has to be taken into account and will govern  the rights of the parties. G.P. Singh: Interpretation of. Indian Statutes, 7th Edn., p. 406. A court in India has ruled that a widow's share in the coparcenary property can be ascertained  by adding the share to which she is entitled at a notional partition during her husband's  lifetime and the share she would have obtained upon his death. Court: Once made, an  irrevocable assumption must permeate the entire process of ascertaining the ultimate share of  the heirs. In Anar Devi (supra), the question of enlargement of right by a legal provision or otherwise  change in the officer's share was not involved. Statutory fiction is with respect to the extent of  share of deceased coparcener in exigency provided in the proviso to section 6 of the Act. Saraswathi Vilasa, placitum 28 states that without any speech (or Explanation) even by  means of a determination (or resolution) only, partition is effected.  There does not need to be an agreement between all the coparceners for the disruption of the  joint status. Vyavahara Mayukha of Nilakantabhatta states that even in the absence of any  common (joint family) property, severance does indeed result by the declaration I am  separate from thee. Suraj Narain v Iqbal Narain, (1913) ILR 35 All 80 the Judicial Committee  made the following categorical statement of the legal position. Notional partition was meant to give effect to Explanation to section 6. It was not to bring  about the real partition. Neither did it affect the interest of surviving coparceners or other  family members entitled to a share but who could not have claimed it. Just filing a suit by  way of severance of status doesn't bring about partition. India's Supreme Court has ruled that a male Hindu coparcener may dispose of his interest in the coparcenary property of a Hindu Mitakshara family by testamentary or intestate succession. The old law before 1956 was  wholly invalid, the Court said. The intention was to avoid any sham or bogus transactions. If a daughter is alive on the date  of enforcement of the Amendment Act, she becomes a coparcener with effect from that date.  Solicitor General argued that the requirement of a registered partition deed may be  interpreted as the only directory and not mandatory in nature. The Court has no hesitation in  adopting the effect of statutory fiction of proviso to section 6. The intention was to avoid any sham or bogus transactions. Solicitor General argued that the  requirement of a registered partition deed may be interpreted as the only directory and not  mandatory. The Court has no hesitation in adopting the effect of statutory fiction of proviso  to section 6. Amicus curiae: Amendments to the Hindu Succession act, 1956 by Andhra Pradesh,  Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu will be superseded by any subsequent Central  enactment. Shri R. Venkataramani, Amicus Curiae, argued that alldispositions, alienations  and testamentary depositions, including partition, shall not be reopened. Partition, for all practical purposes, for legal purposes, should be registered or should have been effected by a  decree of a court. Section 6(2) of the Indian Personal Law Bill provides that a partition may  be effected orally and later on memorandum can be created for memory purposes. The  Committee recommends that the term 'partition' should be properly defined. A family arrangement is final and binding on the parties to the settlement and does not fall  within the mischief of Section 17(2) of the Registration Act. The Court has to keep in mind  the possibility that a plea of oral partition may be set up fraudulently or based on an  unregistered memorandum of partition. One-third share out of what? Two principles compete in this jurisdiction and judges have  struck a fair balance between them. The position of a share of a member of a Mitakshara  Hindu family in which his own issue have no right by birth can be transferred by him at his  will. Section 6(5) is stricter to rule out unjust deprivation to the daughter of the coparcener's  right. No express agreement is required to remain joint. Several acts, though not conclusive  proof of partition, may lead to that conclusion in conjunction with various other facts. A Hindu family can be a joint family - but only if all members of the family agree to reunite  as a joint hindu-Hindu family. The partition so effected before 20.12.2004 is saved. Section 6  of the Act is only to accept the genuine partitions that might have taken place under the  prevailing law. Daughter born after amendment to Hindu Succession Act, 1956 confer  coparcener status on daughter born before or after amendment in the same manner as son. We  overrule the views to the contrary expressed in Prakash v Phulavati and Mangammal v T.B.  Raju & Ors (M.R. Shah). KEYWORDS: Narendra Prasad, thecoparcenary property, coparcenary,ancestral property,Vineeta Sharma  vs Rakesh Sharma,Prakash v.

SECTION
Writ Petition No.278[S/B]
Section 173 of code of criminal procedure, 1973
section 402/465/471 and 120B",1,1,,"This appeal has been preferred against the impugned judgment and order dated 28.5.2004 in
Special Appeal No. 16 of 2003 passed by the High Court of Uttaranchal. The order affirmed
the judgment of the learned Single Judge dismissing the Writ Petition No. 278 (S/B) of 2002.
Facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal are that:
An advertisement was published in September 2001 inviting applications from candidates
eligible for the 250 posts of Constables. He appeared for the physical test and qualified on
28.9.2001. Subsequently, upon passing the written test, his name was mentioned in the list of
selected candidates.
A temporary government servant was discharged on the grounds that he had been involved in
a criminal case. The final report in that case had been submitted by the prosecution and
accepted by the learned Magistrate. On the basis of the same, the appellant was discharged
abruptly on 8.4.2002.
The appellant challenged the said order by filing a writ petition and since he was not favoured
by the learned single Judge, he challenged the same before the Division Bench but to no
avail.
Nanita Sharma, learned counsel appearing for the appellant, has submitted that the appellant
was not aware of any FIR/criminal complaint against him, nor had he been interrogated by
the police at any stage. Nanita Sharma: The appellant was simply supposed to furnish the said
information in 'Nil' with respect to whether he had been punished/convicted/discharged in
any criminal case.
Shri Pankaj Kumar Singh, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent State, has
submitted that the appellant suppressed the material fact of registration of a criminal case
against him. We have considered the rival submissions made by the learned counsel for the
parties and perused the records. The courts below have correctly held the termination as
valid.
An FIR was registered against the appellant and others under Sections 402/465/471 and 120-
B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as 'the IPC') on 10.2.2001. Clause 4
and 7 of the Proforma affidavit to be filled up by every appointee, read as under:That no
cognizable or non-cognizable criminal case or proceeding has been registered against me to
my knowledge and neither have I been fined by the police in any such case and neither is any
(police investigation) pending against me.
Clause 4 deals with a situation, where a case has been registered, an investigation is
conducted and the police have filed a final report. Clause 7 requires, in case, a person has
faced criminal prosecution, he has to furnish the information about the result of that trial as to
whether the person has been punished/convicted/discharged. 9. We have examined the
judgments of the Division Bench as well as of the learned Single Judge, that are based on
pleadings and evidence placed before them, recording the finding that the fact of involvement
in the criminal case had been suppressed.
If an applicant gets an appointment by misrepresentation, it is no more res integra. The
question is not whether the applicant is suitable for the post. The pendency of a criminal
case/proceeding is different from suppressing the information of such pendency. The case
pending against a person might not involve moral turpitude but suppressing of this

information itself amounts to moral Turpitude. In that eventuality, the service becomes liable
to be terminated.
(Vide: S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu (Dead) by LRs. v. Jagannath (Dead) by LRs. & Ors., AIR
1994 SC 853.
The High Court was wrong in affirming the totally unsustainable conclusion reached by the
authorities. The authorities addressed themselves to the wrong questions, misconstrued the
requirements of the section, and reached a totally irrational, unreasonable and unsustainable
conclusion that the original order of the Controller was obtained by fraud. In the
circumstances, I respectfully agree with the findings reached by my learned brother Sahai, J.
Noronah was a provision unique of its kind in a rent control legislation, with a fresh look on
eviction ensuring vacant possession statutorily, after expiry of lease period 'without notice
even' J.R. Vohra v India Export House Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. Shiv Chand Kapoor or hazard of
establishing bonafide need, Pukhraj Jain v PadmaKashyap due to social necessity, peculiar to
Delhi, favourably inclined towards landlord, was subjected to inherent and implied
limitations by this Court in Noronah, S.B. Khanna in larger social interest of fairness and
justice.
As observed in Noronah (supra) the Parliament was keen on maximising accommodation
available for letting, due to a scarcity crisis. The objective was sought to be achieved by
simplifying the provision for letting and assuring possession after expiry of lease. Section 14
of the Landlord's Bill provides that if a landlord lets the whole or part of the premises or part
thereof as a residence for such period as may be agreed to in writing between the landlord
and the tenant, then the landlord can evict the tenant and every other person who may be in
occupation. Noronah (supra) culled out, dual protection for tenants one substantive and other
procedural by providing that validity of sanction could be assailed on fraud etc. Other
conditions, namely, passing of order, letting it for residential purpose, are incidental only.
That is why it has been held to be a self-contained code. Shiv Chand kapoor v. Amar Bose
[1991] 1 SCC 234,.
Anand Saroop: A tenant cannot wait for the entire period of lease and then raise objection to
execution on fraud or collusion unless he is able to establish that it was not known to him and
he came to know of it, for the first time only at the time of execution. In Vohra's case AIR
1985 SC 475, this Court laid down that a tenant who assails the permission was procured by
fraud a ground not dissimilar to the one urged in the present case must approach the Rent
Controller during the currency of the limited tenancy for an adjudication of his pleas as soon
as he discovers facts and circumstances which, according to him, vitiate the permission. In
Pankaj Bhargava Panaj Bhargava v. Mohinder Nath , it was observed;It is true that in
Noronah's case a challenge to the validity of the limited tenancy was permitted even after the
period of limited lease.
It is clear that Yamuna Maloo's objection to execution application was in defence of the
landlord's application for delivery of possession. No exceptional circumstance so as to bring
it within the principle laid down in his case could be deciphered either from the application or
from the statement of the tenant. Neither the Controller nor the Appellate Authority found
any exceptional circumstance which could justify the tenant to resist the execution after

expiry of the period. In fact, from a letter sent, twenty days, before expiry of lease to the
landlord it is clear that the tenant was not only aware that he was required to vacate the
premises after expiry of the time but he requested the landlady to grant him some more
reasonable time for vacating the premises.
In Noronah (supra) the Court did not decide what constitutes fraud or collusion in relation to
Section 21 of the Act. An action is mindless when it is thoughtless or without any care or
caution. There is no statutory requirement for the Controller to enter into enquiry on
application made by a landlord supported by a statement and agreed to by the tenant. In Smt.
Dhanwanti Devi v. D.D.
Gupta it was held that even successive letting under Section 21 prior to grant of sanction
could not adversely reflect on the permission as it was reasonable for landlord to let out
looking to immediate future. The Bench further deprecated the practice of entering into
roving inquiry at the instance of tenant as that would frustrate the very purpose of limited
period of tenancy contemplated by Section 21.
It was held that the invalidity which could vitiate sanction under Section 21 of the Act was
error in fact at the time of grant of permission, as valid sanction was sine qua non for
Controller of Public Prosecution's jurisdiction. An application filed under Section 21 with or
without reasons is neither bad nor contrary to law. It may be accompanied by statement of
reasons or the application may merely state that the landlord does not require the premises for
the period mentioned therein. And if the Controller is satisfied that what was stated was
correct he is obliged to grant permission.
In R. Radhakrishnan v. Director General of Police & Ors., AIR 2008 SC 578, this Court held
that furnishing wrong information by the candidate while seeking appointment makes him
unsuitable for appointment. B. Chinnam Naidu v. Dinesh Kumar (2005) 2 SCC 746, this
court held that facts are to be examined in each individual case. 20. In Secretary, Department
of Home, A.P.& Ors., v. B. Chinnam Naidu, (2005) 2 SCC 746, this Court held that facts are
to be examined in each individual case and the candidate is not supposed to furnish
information which is not specifically required in a case where information sought dealt with
prior convictions by a criminal Court. A person having done wrong cannot take advantage of
his own wrong and plead bar of any law to frustrate the lawful trial by a competent Court. In
such a case the maxim Nullus Commodum Capere Potest De Injuria Sua Propria applies. The
appeal is devoid of any merit and is accordingly dismissed.",,Devendra Kumar vs State Of Uttaranchal _ Ors on 29 July 2013,"[-0.19111057 -0.15059434 -0.08647313 -0.2804659  -0.09829307  0.31839618

dated 27-7-1983, passed in ED Appeal No. 4 ED KKA of 1981-82. According to the facts of
this case, late P. Peda Venkataraju expired on 5-8-1979, leaving behind movable and
immovable properties. Smt. P. Narasaraju has filed an estate duty account on 6-2-1980. The
Appellate Controller, following the ratio of the decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in
the case of CED v. Estate of Late S. Srinivasulu Reddy, A/P Sumanamma [Case Referred No.
107 of 1976, dated 21-12-1979], came to the conclusion that inasmuch as the daughters are
entitled to have share in their father's estate, they are not entitled for maintenance.
Andhra Pradesh High Court Appellate Controller P. Peda Venkataraju has appealed against
the disallowance of Rs. 30,000 claimed by way of marriage expenses for the three unmarried
daughters of late S. Srinivasulu Reddy. The Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956,

according to the learned counsel, makes provision for dependent members of the family vis-
a-vis the property of the deceased and not out of the property which the deceased gets by way

of his share. He further submitted that there was no partition in the present case and we were
only to compute the value of a deceased's interest in the joint family on the assumption of
partition of the family of the family immediately before his death. The obligation as regards
HUF's property will have to be governed by the ancient Hindu law, he said. It was also
submitted that before a partition should be made for maintenance and marriage expenses of
the unmarried daughters.
Section 3(b) of the Act Mad. 329 provides for provision for maintenance and marriage
expenses out of the joint family property. Karuppana Gounder v. Chinna Nachammal was
heard by the Madras High Court. The court refused to accept the contention put forward in
this respect. It cannot therefore be contended that the abrogation of the textual law under
Section 4 of the Act would be limited to the maintenance right in lieu of the estate of the
deceased only and that such textual law as against the remaining part of the joint family
property cannot be said to have been abrogated. Madras High Court: Article 304 of Mulla's
Hindu Law provides for determination of 'the property available for partition' before actual
notional partition can take place. The provisions of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance
Act refer to the maintenance qua deceased's own property only and not the joint family
property in which the deceased also had an interest.
The determination of widow's interest in the coparcenary property came up for consideration
before the Supreme Court in the case of Gurupad Khandappa Magdum v. Hirabai
Khandappanavam. Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, states that the interest of a
Hindu Mitakshara coparcener 'shall be deemed to be' the share in the property allotted to him
if a partition of that property had taken place. To make the assumption at the initial stage of
ascertaining the share of the deceased and then to ignore it is truly to permit one's
imagination to boggle. The allotment of this share is not a processual step devised merely for

the purpose of working out some other conclusion. It has to be treated and accepted as a
concrete reality, something that cannot be recalled just as a share allotted to a coparcener in
an actual partition cannot generally be recalled. The inevitable corollary of this position is
that the heir will get his or her share in the interest which the deceased had in the coparcenary
property at the time of his death, in addition to the share he or she received in the notional
partition.
Shri Krishna-swami Iyer was a member of the Hindu coparcenary consisting of himself, his
wife and three sons. Smt. Alladi died on 5-1-1956, a few months before passing of the Hindu
Succession Act. The Assistant Controller valued her estate at Rs. 7,25,527 including a sum of
Rs. 2,02,271 being the value of her share in the joint family properties. Smt. Smt. Alladi died
as a Hindu widow and was a member of a Hindu coparcenary, but her interest merged
without benefit accruing or arising to the coparceners of Section 7(1) of the Act had no
application, the Supreme Court of India has ruled. Her interest merged with that of a cessor of
her interest and her interest became part of the coparcenary property which passed on her
death.
Dr. B. Kamalamma's widow claimed a deduction of Rs. 72,000 as provision for the marriage
of her daughter. The Assistant Controller and the Appellate Controller held that under the
Hindu law, an obligation of this sort is enforceable against the ancestral property which the
deceased died possessed of. On appeal, the High Court held as under:. She claimed, inter alia,
a deduction for Rs. 72,000 as provision for the marriage of the daughter. The Hindu
Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, provides for the obligation of a Hindu father to
perform and spend for the marriage of his unmarried daughter. The liability of the family
property in this regard is independent of the father's personal obligation to get the daughter
married. This liability does not fall under any of the special categories covered by Clauses (a)
to (d) of Section 44 of the Estate Duty Act, 1953.
The court was also drawn to a passage in the Principles of Hindu Law by Mulla, 15th edn.,
para 440, which states: Marriage is a sanskara, and its expenses, therefore, are to be provided
for out of the joint-family property. Section 68, the Indian Contract Act, makes it doubtful
whether the marriage of an infant girl could be brought under the head of 'Necessaries' within
the meaning of section 68, according to the court. Marriage expenses - In the case of a joint
family governed by the Mitakshara law, the joint family property is liable, while the family is
still joint, for the legitimate marriage expenses of male members of the family (k), and also of
the daughters of male members of the family.
In the case of marriage expenses of a daughter, a text-book called Principles and Precedents
of Hindu Law by N.R. Raghavachariar, 6th edn., states as under: Under the Mitakshara, the
marriage expenses of the male members of a joint family and of their daughters are borne by
the family property so long as the family is joint. N.R. Raghavachariar, 6th edn., states as
under:. Expenses of marriage - Marriage being a sacrament with the Hindus, its performance,
especially for girls, is an imperative duty upon the manager of the family. The mother of a
girl who gave her away in marriage without consulting her husband's father, is entitled to
recover reasonable expenses of the marriage out of the joint property of the girl's father and
her maternal uncle. The property of a Hindu passing into the hands of his collateral heirs after
his death, is liable for the reasonable marriage expenses of the daughter of the last holder's
predeceased son.

The learned Appellate Controller relied upon a judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court
in the case of Estate of Srinivasulu Reddy, A/P S. Sumanamma (supra) Sub-section (2) of
Section 21 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act provides for deduction of a sum of
Rs. 1,00,000 towards maintenance, educational and marriage expenses of his one year old
minor daughter. The High Court also took note of the decision in CED v. Estate of Late
Omprakash Bajaj (1977) 110 ITR 263 (AP).
Smt. P. Leelavathamma (supra) claimed deduction of Rs. 2,79,510 towards the maintenance
expenses of the daughter including marriage expenses. On appeal, the accountable person
raised an additional contention that the estate duty payable on the estate has to be deducted
from the gross estate. On these facts, the Andhra Pradesh High Court held as under. Section
22(2) Section 8 of Hindu Succession Act. Andhra Pradesh High Court High Court. P.
Leelavathamma: The Appellate Tribunal was not right in law in allowing deduction towards
maintenance expenses of the wife of the deceased from the estate passing on his death. But so
long as the right does not take that concrete or choate shape, it cannot be said that the
husband cannot dispose of the property as he liked.
Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in S. Kameshwaramma's case (supra)
observed that a combined reading of Sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 22 of the Hindu
Adoptions and Maintenance Act marriage expenses excludes dependants acquiring a share in
the property of a person who died after the Act from claiming maintenance.
The Madras High Court has ruled that Article 304 of Mulla's Hindu Adoptions and
Maintenance Act does not relate to 'the property available for partition' before actual, notional
partition can take place. However, the Tribunal preferred to follow the ratio of the judgment
of the Madras HC in the case of Karuppana Gounder (supra) against Smt. K. S. Jayain's
ancestral property. The distinction drawn before us by the learned counsel. refers to the
maintenance qua deceased's own property only and not the joint family property in which the
deceased also had an interest. Madras High Court: The provision for the marriage of
unmarried daughters in a Hindu family being enforceable against ancestral property, it has
got to be deducted as a debt or encumbrance under Section 44 of the Estate Duty Act, 1953,
wherever the dutiable estate includes ancestral property of the deceased. Dr.
B.Kamalamalamalamma's case (supra) was not in existence at the time when the Special
Bench of the Tribunal decided the case in Smt. K.S. Jay am (Supra) that the liability of the
ancestral or coparcenary property of a Hindu would be a proper debt deductible under the
general provisions of Section 44.
Thus, considering the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing for the assessee in
the light of the commentaries occurring in Mulla's Hindu Law, Principles and Practice of
Hindu Law by N.R. Raghavachariar and the judicial pronouncements, we hold that the
liability of ancestral or coparcenary property of a Hindu to pay for marriage expenses of
unmarried daughters in the family would be a proper debt or encumbrance deductible under
the general provisions of Section 44, where the deceased died possessed of such property.
They say: We hold that the liability of ancestral or coparcenary property of a Hindu to pay for
marriage expenses of unmarried daughters in the family would be a proper debt or
encumbrance deductible under the general provisions of Section 44, where the deceased died
possessed of such property. The appeal stands partly allowed.",,Pusarla Narasaraju vs Assistant Controller Of Estate on 22 September 1984,"[ 0.42497063 -0.12385178  0.0267486  -0.06568485 -0.24784867  0.4732217

:ORDER 

Inspite of many penal laws and the recent POSCO Act, 2012 prescribing severe
punishment for crimes against children, the number of such cases has increased from 38,172 in 2012 to 58,224 in 2013 and to 89,423 in 2014.
It is shocking to hear that a toddler, aged about 4 years, was brutally gang raped by four devilish perpetrators in New Delhi on 9th October,2015 and she got injuries all over her body, particularly, on her private parts and had been bleeding profusely. 
 The are a few of the cases of abuse of children, ranging from 11 months to 10 years, reported in the Media in 2015 alone would fortify the existence of inefficient Police Administration and ineffective laws and shock one and all in the so-called civilized society; 
Therefore, she would, strenuously, contend that it is not a case for quashing the proceedings and she would rely upon the Apex Court judgements in Bachpan Bachao Andolan vs. Union of India (UOI) and others, Employment of children At Circus case reported in JT 2011 (5) SC 68, Childline India Foundation and another vs. Allan John General Waters and others reported in (2011) 6 SCC 261,Prema Lama @ Mama vs. State of Assam reported in 2013 (3) GLT 80 (Gau), Ilyasuddin vs. State reported in MANU/DE/0213/2014 and Werner Wulf Ingo vs. State of Goa reported in MANU/MH/0207/2009. She also filed guidelines for standard of operative procedure in matters relating to sexual offences against the children, the International Child Protection Certificate of United Kingdom, which has comprehensive guidelines, including a certificate, showing the person on criminal record as it was recorded at the time of issue and she seeks suitable guidelines to prevent child abuse. 
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Rachapalli Abbulu & Ors. vs. State of A.P. reported in 2002 (3) Supreme 172 deprecated the practice of getting affidavit from the victim or witness by the accused. It has been stated in paragraph-11 of the said judgement,
There are statements made by the Members of Child Welfare Committee under Section 161(3) of the Cr.P.C. to support the prosecution case. Similarly, District Social Welfare Officer, also made the similar statement. When a statutory Child Welfare Committee members have given 161 statement and the District Social Welfare Officer also made similar statement definitely it is a case for trial and the proceedings cannot be quashed. The petitioner cannot seek quashing of the proceedings stating that when the witnesses have denied their statements, continuation of proceedings is a wasteful exercise and meaningless. However, as explained above, when a case has been made out for trial, it cannot be termed as a wasteful exercise and meaningless. Therefore, the judgement cited in V.D.Ray vs. State of Kerala reported in (2000) 8 SCC 590 is not useful to the petitioner MAJOR FINDINGS Across different kinds of abuse, it is the young children, in the 5-12 year group,
who are most at risk of abuse and exploitation. Physical abuse There is very little research on
physical abuse in India. Only two earlier studies are mentioned.
Sexual Abuse 
1. 53.22% children reported having faced one or more forms of sexual abuse,
2. Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar and Delhi reported the highest percentage of sexual abuse among
both boys and girls.
3. 21.90% child respondents facing severe forms of sexual abuse and 50.76% other forms of sexual abuse.
4. Out of the children respondents, 5.69% reported being sexually assaulted.
5. Children in Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Delhi reported the highest incidence of sexual assault.
6. Children on street, children at work and children in institutional care reported the highest
incidence of sexual assault.
7. 50% abuses are persons known to the child or in a position of trust and responsibility.
8.Most Children did not report the matter to anyone.
 A Survey by United Nations Children Education Fund (UNICEF-I) was conducted in India from 2005 to 2013 which reported that 10% of Indian girls might have experienced sexual violation, when they were 10 to 14 years of age and 30% during 15 to 19 years of age. Overall, nearly 42% of Indian girls have gone through trauma of sexual violence before teenage. 
 A report by the Asian Centre for Human Rights states that India saw an increase of 36% of child rape cases from 2001 (2,113 cases) to 2011 (7,112 cases). As per 2001 census, about 440 million individuals in India were below 18 years of age and constitutes 42% of total population. A total of 33098 cases of child sex abuse were recorded in India during 2011, when compared to 26694 reported in 2010. For every 155 minutes a child, less than 16 years is raped, for every 13th hour a child under 10 year is sexually abused. At any point of time, it is estimated by the Government that 40% of Indian children are susceptible to threats and like being homeless trafficking, drug abuse, forced labour. In India, every second, a child is being exposed to one or other form of sexual abuse and the child faces critical form of it. 
CASTRATION AS ADDITIONAL PUNISHMENT FOR CHILD ABUSERS
National Crime Records Bureau report, 2014 states that crime against children in Delhi got
doubled within two years. A total of 21,011 cases of crime against children were reported between 2012 and 2014 and in or about 10% of the cases are all rapes. It is reported in NCRB reports most of the crimes in India have fallen from 2001 to 2011 except rape which got increased by 50.6%.
According to NCRB reports, 364 rape cases of girl child of 10 years of age below are reported in 2013 and 2014 and the crime rate against toddlers is on the rise. In view of constant increase in child abuse cases, to protect children from sexual abuses, a Special Act has been enacted by the Parliament viz. Protection of Children against the Sexual Offence Act, 2012. From November, 2012 to March 2015, 6816 cases were registered under POSCO Act. Out of 6816 cases, 556 cases only went for trial, 166 cases alone got convicted, and 389 cases ended in acquittal and the conviction rate is 2.4%. Rajasthan has maximum of 936 cases followed by Maharastra-926, U.P. 869, M.P. 829 and Kerala-596. Every second, child in India is facing some form of abuse, irrespective of whether it is a girl or a boy. Since there is a dangerous increase in child rape cases, decrease in the incidence of
these types of cases is possible only by means of severe conviction. Until there is fear of law, such incidents would not stop.
DIRECTIONS
1. additional punishment apart from other punishments under POSCO Act, I.P.C.
J.J.Act etc., in view of abnormal increase in child abuse cases. 
2.Central Government is to take a decision with regard to introduction of Free and Compulsory Comprehensive Sexuality Education in High School level to enable the students to understand gender identity, their sexuality, age related physical changes and problems, to protect themselves from sex advances and abuses etc., as India has its commitment under United Nations, International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) agenda 1994 affirming the Sexual and Reproductive Rights (SRRs) of adolescents and young people as per Article 253 of the Constitution of India. 
3.The Central Government shall direct all the State Governments to give special training to
medical practitioners to deal with and manage victims of child abusers as the medical professionals mostly do not have required training in this regard.

This is an application for stay of trial of C.C. No. 8277 of 1952 on the file of the 8th Presidency  Magistrate, George Town, Madras, pending disposal of C. S. No. 158 of 1952 on the file of the High  Court oh the original side.

 The two petitioners Y. Ranganayakalu Chetty and Doraisami Ayyangar 
constituted a partnership along with the respondent K. Gopala Chetty & K. Lakshminarayana Chetty  and K. Satyanarayana Chetty under the style and name of Sri C. P. V. Kotiah Chetty and Company, carrying on business as commission agents t No. 21, Chinnathambi Mudali Street, George Town, Madras on 25-7-1951. 
It provides that each of these petitioners  contributed Rs. 25,000/- and the partners were to 
share the profits in the following proportion:1-4-6.  The actual working of the partnership was in the hands of Ranganayakalu  Chetty and Doraisami Ayyangar. The complainant, Lakshminarayana Chetty, and Satyanarayana Chetty were advancing considerable capital. Therefore the complainant and the two others were 
alone given the power to operate on the bank accounts, to accept cheques etc. for and on behalf of the partnership while Ranganayakalu Chetty and Doraisami Ayyangar had no such right. 
Their partnership came to grief in 1952.
The complainant became aware of the fraud 
practised by the petitioners in collusion with one another on or about 8-6-1953 and started 
collecting information regarding the misappropriation, whereafter the petitioners wanted to make it appear as if the collection, of about Rs. 65,000/- was to be debited against the personal account of the first petitioner. 
The version of Ranganayakalu Chetty & Doraisami Ayyangar is as follows: The cash balance as per the firm's books for the first week of June 1952 of over Rs. 55,000/- was in the hands of the complainant while a sum of Rs. 15,000/- was in the Banks.
K. Gopala Chetty thereupon filed the complaint on 14-6-1952 & Lakshminarayana Chetty filed a suit for dissolution of partnership on 24-6-1952.

Section 344, Criminal P. C., authorizes, only the postponement or adjournment of criminal cases from time to time. The power of the High Court in this respect is expressly recognised by Section 561-A, Criminal P. C. The High Court had also, independent of Section 561-A, power under Section 107, Government of India Act, 1915, to stay proceedings in subordinate Courts in the exercise of its powers of superintendence over inferior Courts. But under Section 224, Government of India Act, 1935, which corresponds to Section 107 of the Act of 1915 the High Court was held to have no power 
to interfere with the judicial orders of the lower Courts: see Sub-section (2) of Section 224 and the two undermentioned cases -- 'Sakkal v. Issurdas', ILR (1941) 2 Cal 366 and--'Jahnabi v. Basudeb', 54 Cal W N 626. Under the Constitution of India, in Art. 227, which is a reproduction of Section 224, Government of India Act, 1935, Sub-section (2) of Section 224 has been omitted. This omission of Sub-section (2) of Section 224 in Article 227 shows that the Constitution of India has restored the power which the High Court had under the Government of India Act of 1915: --'Abdul Rahim v. Abdul Jabbar', 54 Cal W N 445; and --- 'Bimala Prcsad v. State of West Bengal', (SB). Court justice will be done -- per Jackson, J. in -- 'C. Ramiah v. N. Ramiah', 50 Mad 839: -- Magannath Acharya v. Rajagopalachari', AIR 1931 Pat 411; -- 'Rewatmal Udhomal v. Sajanmul Mehrumal', AIR 1934 Sind 143; -- 'Kanhai   Lal v. Baij Nath Mahesri', AIR 1933 Nag 78. There is no hard and fast rule in this matter. 
The Court should consider the circumstances of each particular case and decide on grounds of justice and expediency whether it is proper that the criminal proceedings should be stayed or that the civil proceedings should be stayed or that both should be allowed to take their course -- per Broom field, J. in -- 'Dias v. Mahadev', 35 Born L R 1054.

In -- 'Md. Ibrahirn v. Kattayyan', AIR 1916 Mad 1123 the facts were: There was refusal, to register a document alleged to be forged. There was a suit to compel registration. The High Court held that the criminal trial must be stayed pending disposal of the civil suit 
to compel registration. In -- 'Jhummaklal v. Sunderlal', AIR 1932 Nag 86, where the very 
constitution of committee' of trustees which authorised a particular individual, 
to lodge on its behalf a criminal complaint against the manager of the trust property was challenged . In -- 'Khobhari Rai v. Bhagwat Rai', AIR 1917 Pat 621 there was a suit in regard to property and there xvas a charge of theft of such property. It was held that the criminal case should be stayed. In -- 'Debi Mahto v. Emperor'. Am. 1916 Pat 7 (2) proceedings were instituted as a result of an order under Section 476, Criminal P. C. 
In -- 'U. Tha Zan v. U Pyant', AIR 1935 Rang 487. It was rightly pointed out that it is no doubt undesirable that a criminal prosecution connected with a civil suit should be proceeded with until the civil suit is decided;instant case we find that no case has been made out for 
staying the criminal proceedings pending disposal of the suit which has been subsequently filed by one of the partners. It cannot be stated for the reasons mentioned in --'Gnanasigamani Nadar v. Vedamuthu Nadar', 52 Mad L J 80 that any prejudice would be caused to the accused in this case if The criminal trial proceeded with. It will be open to these accused to put forward all the matters which would be open to them in the civil suit and probably within a shorter compass and repel the accusations against them.

This revision petition is directed against the order of the Subordinate Judge, Mahbubnagar, in 
I.A.No. 82 of 1988 in O.S. No. 42 ofl972 filed by the plaintiff for passing a final decree in terms of preliminary decree. 
the Court passed a preliminary decree on 26-12-1973declaring that he is entitled to 1/3rd share in the plaint A, C and D schedule properties. The High Court confirmed the findings of
the trial Court on 15-10-1984 holding that the plaintiff, the 4th defendant and the first defendant areentitled to 1 / 3rd share each and also directed the trial Court while passing a final decree to makeappropriate provision for maintenance and marriage expenses of defendants 5 to 9 and maintenanceof the third defendant out of totality of joint family properties shall be borne equally by each of theplaintiff, 4th defendant and first defendant. 29-Band 29-C of the Hindu Succession Act of 1956, defendants 6 to 9 being unmarried daughters are alsoentitled for a share on par with their brothers, since the properties have not been divided so far. The trial Court found that a preliminary decree was passed and an appeal was also preferred
against the preliminary decree and that appeal was also dismissed confirming the preliminary
decree passed by the trial Court and in that situation the contention of the defendants that the
properties have not yet been divided and so the unmarried daughters are also entitled to the share isnot tenable. The suit was filed for partition in 1972 and a preliminary decree was passed in 1973 declaring that the plaintiff is entitled to 1/3rd share. The lower Court came to the conclusion that when apreliminary decree was passed declaring the shares of the parties, it is not open to the unmarrieddaughters to claim shares in those properties by virtue of the amended provisions of the HinduSuccession Act, 1956.
The contention that has been raised on behalf of the daughters who are respondents 6 to 9 in the lower Court is that the Court below failed to take into consideration the amended provisions of the Hindu Succession Act correctly. The lower Court also failed to take note that it is a settled law that a suit for partition of the joint family properties should be deemed to be pending till a final decree is passed and merely because a preliminary decree was passed before the Hindu Succession (Andhra Pradesh Amendment) Act, 1956 (XIII of 1986) came into force on 5-9-1985 the rights of the unmarried daughters conferred under the said Act cannot be said to be unenforceable.. Section 29-A which is inserted by the Act (XIII of 1986) reads as follows: ""29-A. Equal rights to daughter in coparcenary property: Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 6 of this Act
e have to consider the meaning of the words ""partition which had been effected"" occurring in Clause (iv) of S. 29-A of the Hindu Succession Act.
""During the pendency of a suit"" mean 'before a final decree or order has been passed or made in the suit'. Hence, the provisions of this rule (O.22, R. 10) apply if the assignment, creation or devolution of interest takes place before a final decree or order is passed or made in the suit. . . . .Until the decree is passed, a transferee 'pendents lite' is entitled to apply under this rule to be joined as a party."" 
The Bombay High Court in Parashu-ram Rajaram Tiwari v. Hirabai Rajaram Tiwari, , has considered a case in similar situation. In that case the plaintiff filed a suit for partition. After contest a preliminary decree has been passed holding that the plaintiff was entitled for 1 / 8th share.
By this, the law as summarised from the above three judgments is clear and it must be held as a settled proposition that after the passing of the preliminary decree in a partition suit before passing of the final decree if there has been either enlargement or diminution of the shares or rights of the parties have been changed by reason of the rights that have been conferred by the statute or rights of the parties by a second or by subsequent purchase or by assignments of interest by whatever cause, the Court, before passing its final decree, has to consider and decide the matter and grant a final decree in accordance with such subsequent devolutions to avoid multiplicity of suits and give complete and appropriate relief to alt the parties.
 It is to be noted here that a Division Bench of this Court in Rahmat Bee v. Maqbool Banu (1989) 2 APLJ (HC) 220 found that even the defendant also can file a petition, in a partition suit, for passing a final decree. When the defendant also is entitled to file a petition for passing a final decree, I fail to understand why the unmarried daughters, who are given statutory rights under S. 29A of the Hindu Succession Act, cannot file an application for passing of a final decree in the light of the findings that have already been arrived at by the trial court. 22. The order of the lower Court is set aside and the revision petition is allowed, at no costs.

The applicant along with other co-accused person created a fake facebook ID of District Magistrate, Satna and made a request to acquaintance of thecomplainant for sending money. On such request, one Jitendra Kushwaha send a sum of Rs.20,000/- and informed to the complainant. When the complainant received this information, he immediately informed the police. The police acted on the information and traced out the bank account in which was deposited. In such circumstances, it is prayed that the applicant be released on bail on the grounds that there is no progress in the trial.

An application has been made by Jogendra @ Chandan Agrawal to be enlarged on bail in the case of Deepak Sharma (supra) and other co-accused person. Learned Panel Lawyer for the respondent/State has vehemently opposed theapplication. He submits that it is a grave case of cyber crime. It is very difficult to collect and prove evidence and caught accused persons in such cases.

This notion has also been reflected in the Preamble of the RTI Act, which stipulates as follows: ""An Act to provide for setting out the practical regime of right to information for citizens to secure access to information under the control of public authorities, in order to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority, the constitution of a Central Information Commission and State Information Commissions and for matters connected therewith or incidental Mr. S S Ranawat vs Cbi on 4 July, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/315741/ 8 thereto. However, when the fundamental right to information was being codified by way of the RTI Act, the Parliament felt that certain ""intelligence and security organisations"" may require greater protection from disclosure of information and therefore stipulated Section 24(1) of the RTI Mr. S S Ranawat vs Cbi on 4 July, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/315741/ 7 Act. Under Section 24(2) of the RTI Act, the DOPT, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions has, vide the said notification stated as follows:
""G. 442 (E).- In exercise of the powers conferred by sub- section (2) of Section 24 of
the Right to Information Act, 2005 (22 of 2005), the Central Government hereby makes the
following further amendments in the Second Schedule to the said Act, namely:-
Therefore, even at the cost of abridging the fundamental right to information of citizens, the Parliament identified certain bodies as ""intelligence and security organisations"" that required to be protected from disclosure of information to serve a greater purpose. The exemptions contained in Section 8(1) of the RTI Act are adequate and comprehensive to ensure that disclosure of information does not inter alia compromise national security or impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution or endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.

THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE S.K. SAHOO

On 18.05.2020 an email was received from one Trilochan Mohanty, Deputy General
Manger-Ethics at Tata Motors Limited (hereafter `the Company`), Jamshedpur Works, Jamshedpur as authorised representative addressed to the IG, CID, CB, Cuttack, Odisha alleging therein that it  was brought to the notice of the Company on several occasions that certain unscrupulous elements were committing fraud and thereby causing harm to the reputation of the Company by contacting common public with criminal intent to defraud them and collect illicit money from them on the pretext of offering them jobs in the Company.

Pathak and that the petitioner was taking huge amount of money fraudulently from unemployed youth to secure them a job in the Company.

The fake ID card and visiting card indicated having `TATA` stylized word mark as it appears on various passenger and commercial vehicles manufactured by TML. Those cards were having the `T in circle` blue design mark which is a mark appearing on various passenger and commercial vehicles manufactured by TML by which the public identifies theconglomerate and the various products offered. The email id of such person mentioned in the email has the word `Tata` in it.
The person sending email found certain other evidence in support of the complaints pertaining to the petitioner that he had donated rupees five lakhs by fraudulently portraying himself as a M.D. (I/C) of the Passenger Division at Pune to the CM of Odisha at his official residence in Bhubaneswar, Odisha which can be found in the newspaper articles at

Mr. Manjit Singh, Public Prosecutor,
Mr. Anand Keshari.
...for the State.

It appears from the order dated August 9, 2016 passed by learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Barasat, North 24 Parganas that learned Public Prosecutor filed an application under Section 410 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for transfer of G.R. no.239 of 2016 from the court of learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bidhannagar to any other court of learned Judicial Magistrate in the district headquarters at Barasat on the ground that both learned Judicial Magistrate, Bidhannagar and learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bidhannagar recorded the statement of the witnesses under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure during investigation of Cyber Crime Police Case no.22 of 2016 and both of them may be cited as prosecution witnesses. On the other hand, Mr. Manjit Singh, learned Public Prosecutor, submits that learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate is subordinate to learned Chief Judicial Magistrate and as such learned Chief Judicial Magistrate can invoke the power under Section 410 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for transfer of the case from the court of learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bidhannagar to any other court of learned Magistrate within the district of North 24 Parganas. The petitioners Rajat Kayan and Rohit Kayan have also challenged the order dated August 18, 2016 passed by learned Additional Chief Judicial  Magistrate, Barasat in connection with G.R. no.239 of 2016 arising out of Cyber Crime Police Case no.22 of 2016 dated March 17, 2016 under Sections 419/420/467/468 /384/120B/506/34 of the Indian Penal Code read with Sections 66/66D of the Information Technology Act, 2000 by preferring revision being CRR no.2810 of 2016. Mr. Sabyasachi Banerjee, learned counsel, accompanied by Mr. Sourav Chatterjee, learned counsel representing the petitioners submits that learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bidhannagar is not subordinate to the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Barasat and as such learned Judicial Magistrate cannot transfer the case from the court of learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bidhannagar to any other court of learned Magistrate under Section 410 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. On perusal of the impugned order dated August 18, 2016 passed by learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Barasat in connection with G.R. no.239 of 2016 corresponding to G.R. no.3031 of 2016, I find that learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate has not disposed of the application filed by the accused Rajat Kayan under Section 207 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but he has proceeded to post the case on August 22, 2016 for consideration of the charge. By challenging the order dated August 18, 2016 passed by learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Barasat, Mr. Banerjee, learned counsel, contends that learned Magistrate has arbitrarily posted the case for consideration of charge on August 22, 2016 without giving reasonable time to the accused persons to go through voluminous documents spread over 810 pages. Similarly, the petitioner Sudipta Ganguly has also challenged the order dated August 18, 2016 passed by learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Barasat in connection with Cyber Crime Police Station Case no.22 of 2016 dated March 17, 2016 under Sections 419/420/467/468/384/120B/506/34 of the Indian Penal Code read with Sections 66/66D of the Information Technology Act, 2000 by filing revisional application being CRR no.2811 of 2016. Learned Magistrate has observed that copy of all documents have been supplied to the accused persons on June 20, 2016 and on June 23, 2016, but it appears from the order of learned Magistrate that some additional documents have been supplied to the accused persons even on August 18, 2016. Case no.10 of 2016 that learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Barasat transferred G.R. no.239 of 2016 from the court of learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bidhannagar to the court of learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Barasat by invoking the provision of Section 410 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Case no.10 of 2016, by which learned Magistrate transferred G.R. no.239 of 2016 from the court of learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bidhannagar to the court of learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Barasat, North 24 Parganas. The other two revisional applications arise out of order dated August 18, 2016 passed by learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Barasat in G.R. no.239 of 2016, by which learned Magistrate refused to grant time to the petitioner to go through the voluminous documents before posting the case for consideration of the charge. So, the order dated August 18, 2016 passed by learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Barasat in G.R. no.239 of 2016 corresponding to G.R. no.3031 of 2016 is set aside and the subsequent orders if any passed by learned Magistrate are also set aside. "" In view of my above findings, I do not find any illegality in the order of transfer of G.R. no.239 of 2016 from the court of learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bidhannagar to the court of learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Barasat by learned Chief Judicial Magistrate under Section 410 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. When voluminous documents spreading over more than 800 pages have been supplied to the accused persons who arein custody and when the accused persons are praying for reasonable time to scrutinise the documents for preparation of defence, learned Magistrate should have granted time to the accused persons to go through voluminous documents before posting the case for consideration of the charge.
